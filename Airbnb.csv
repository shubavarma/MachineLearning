23,UFO  'Futuro styled Flying Saucer'!," Planes for Rent in Redberth, United Kingdom ",Toby,Minty,"A stark kooky space for people looking for the basics of glamping. A little lacking in cosy touches but it is a space ship and they're not known for their comforts! That said, the bed was comfortable and the communal kitchen well stocked with equipment. The space had some great points (kids galaxy projector for the ceiling at night was cool) and some that could do with some work (we loved the styling of the retractable steps but the noise was a surprise, especially at night!) We had a great weekend, curled up in a storm, snug as bugs in space.",4

40,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Rebecca,"We stayed at Dunc & Dee's for 6 nights. We loved the proximity to the Royal Mile, Waverly Station, and really everywhere we wanted to go in Edinburgh was walkable from the flat. It was also close to our daughter's uni accommodations, which was a huge plus!

The flat was cozy and had everything we needed for a stay that felt like we were at home. The bed was comfy, the towels were fluffy and the body wash, shampoo, lotion etc. were wonderful. We enjoyed the fabulous coffee, and now my husband wants to buy a mocha pot!

Communication was great. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of old town.",5

I don‚Äôt want to give away this secret little gem but honestly, this is one of the best airbnbs I‚Äôve stayed in. 

First off, you can‚Äôt beat the location. Everything is at your door step. The whole apartment is so well done, especially given the age of the building it is. Dunc and Dee went out of their way to leave champagne and homemade cookies. I wish all airbnbs were this well done!

I will happily stay here again  anytime I am in Edinburgh.",5
45,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Chris,"Count yourself lucky that this Artsy Flat is available during your dates! It was the absolute best thing about our 6 day stay in Edinburgh. It is filled with everything you need or could want: fresh flowers,  a welcome bottle of bubbly in the fridge, a starter supply of really good tea and coffee (and milk), upscale soap, etc at all sinks and in the shower, hair conditioner, the best iron I‚Äôve ever used (Bosch‚Äôs), windows that open onto a Royal Mile intersection containing the best Womens‚Äô wear shop in town. I could go on and on, but let me end with the fact that the Artsy Flat is walkable to everything you will want to see in Old Town or beyond! I can‚Äôt wait to get back.",5
46,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Lindsie,"The obvious: Location location location. Mere steps from the royal mile and snugly in old town. Couldn‚Äôt have picked a better spot
The not as obvious: Duncan and Dee have done a fantastic job of curating a home away from home. Everything from the space to the personal touches and welcome homemade shortbread was perfection. 
Highly highly recommend this stay",5
47,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Marcie,"Wonderful place! The location was perfect, right off the Royal Mile.  The hosts left very detailed directions for the apartment along with a list of suggestions for food, drinks, and entertainment. We really appreciated all the recommendations. 
    The apartment was very nice and well equipped. When we were not out exploring the city we enjoyed relaxing in the apartment. We would  highly recommend this place.",5

51,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Margie,Dunc & Dee‚Äôs flat is super cute with the living room and kitchen being larger than we expected. It was great to make ourselves coffee in the morning and lounge in the comfy living room while planning our day. The location couldn‚Äôt be more convenient but you do have to get your suitcase up two flights so pack light.  üòä,5
52,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Holly,"Had a great experience here. The hosts really thought of everything you could need during your stay. The location is great, the view from the flat is charming, and the hosts really made it easy.

They made sure the flat was well stocked and we really enjoyed our stay.

There was one small issue that Dee immediately took care of.  Things can happen and it's really how people respond that make the difference for me.

5 stars all around!",5
55,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Dawn,"The flat is in an ideal location to enjoy central Edinburgh and the main windows have a lovely view. The bathroom was very modern and there was a great supply of hot water and high-end toiletries. Luckily, the bedroom is at the back of the flat so it is perfectly quiet because you can hear quite a bit of traffic going over the brick street in the living room, but as long as you shut the bedroom door, it is very peaceful. The kitchen has everything that you need to make meals at home, including some cooking basics like oil, salt, pepper, etc. The flat is on a mid-level floor, so going up and down to street level was not a problem. I would say that the flat is relatively small (and I am from NYC so I know what small looks like), so I would not suggest this flat for a family, it is appropriate for a solo traveler or a couple. My only critiques would be that the flat is not idea for working, as the only table is very small and it is difficult to work on a computer with a mouse and still have space to take notes in meetings, but if you are not working full-time like me, then this will not be an issue. Also, the internet runs at about 25-35 MBpS, which was fine for my work situation, but others who need high-speed access might want to keep that in mind. Overall, I would say that the flat is lovely for holiday travelers looking for a convenient and well-stocked space.",5
56,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Scott,"Excellent location and everything needed for a relaxed and comfortable stay in Edinburgh.  Steps from the Royal Mile, an easy 10-15 minute walk to Princes Street and the New Town, plenty of restaurants and bars within minutes of the flat.  Hosts provided a useful list of recommendations regarding food and drink. Shower water pressure perfect.  Great choice for 1-2 people.",5
57,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Bryan,We throughly enjoyed our stay.

59,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Monica,"The apartment is in a perfect location in Edinburgh to see the Royal Mile and to join tours of Scotland.  It was well equipped with kitchen and bathroom essentials.  The hosts were very communicative with check in and left us a welcoming package.  There was also a few pages available of instructions and restaurant recommendations.  Hosts were easy to reach at all times.  It was a benefit to be able to explore the sights and have the apartment within walking distance of restaurants, the train station, and attractions.  There is also a nice view from one window!  A very pleasant experience!",5
60,Walk the Royal Mile from an Artsy Flat," Flats for Rent in Edinburgh, City of Edinburgh, United Kingdom ",Dunc & Dee,Janet,"The best thing about Dee and Dunc‚Äôs place is the location‚Äîjust off the middle of the Royal Mile and right around the corner from a few cafe‚Äôs, pubs, and a small grocery store.  The place is small and up two flights of stairs but very functional with a comfy bed and great water pressure in the shower.  They also had a bathroom sink with drawers, something we had not seen before. They also provided a bottle of wine, starter coffee, and some fresh flowers to make us feel welcome.  Check in was clear (even if we did accidentally go to the wrong door first!), and they were kind enough to let us know that the place was ready early. Dee and Dunc also left clear instructions and good recommendations for restaurants and cafes.  We tried Mimi‚Äôs around the corner for scones, and Outsider for lunch one day (highly recommend). Another restaurant we liked for its quieter atmosphere but great food was Le Bistro, in the French Embassy.",5

The location was convenient to Sainsbury, which allowed us to get groceries and make breakfast each day at the flat. There are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, and we enjoyed being able to walk to a lot of the attractions within about 15 minutes. We were lucky to be there during the Christmas Market,  and especially enjoyed strolling through the many choices of food and gifts and some impressive rides. Located down by Waverly train station, it is all beautifully lit up at night, and with the castle and monuments in the background, it is spectacular.

Upon entry and setting our bags down (gentle note on mobility: there is a spiral staircase to ascend with all your luggage before arriving at door), we were greeted with an adorably package stack of Dee's homemade shortbread!  We promptly made a proper cuppa and sat down and enjoyed a nice moment together in their lovely space, after a long hard day of travel. 
The tasty treats were a nice touch! The view of the beautiful Scottish architecture from the 1800s out the windows was a nice addition to our first few moments in Edinburgh.  
The Shower Room was cozy, with the heated towel rack, and the lovely rain shower style shower head, it was really nice to have a warm shower there after a long day of adventuring! 

The bathroom is split up into two rooms, the shower and sink are in one room, then the toilet and separate additional sink are in a separate room, (note it is a much smaller room, quite a bit small to navigate if in the middle of the night or not used to small, tight spaces.  It worked perfectly for us, I actually like it being a private little rest room nook, more true to the name ""water Closet"", but just a gentle heads up if you have a larger party.)
The kitchen was perfectly lovely & had everything we needed, (including a washer for laundry which was much required at this point in the trip), a cupboard stocked with tea, and the mini fridge even had milk and a bottle of prosecco for us although we did not have the use for it this trip, the addition was a nice touch and much appreciated! :)

The bedroom was lovely and stylish, with comfy pillows, and duvet! Loved that there was a spare blanket for those chilly fall Edinburgh evenings.  Bed was standard, spouse & I were split on comfortable level, so to each their own.  It was a much welcome rest point after an exhausting travel day.

Another appreciated ""bonus touch"" was the Bluetooth speaker, we enjoyed playing relaxing music in the evenings and curling up with a couple cups of tea.

  It was quite lovely staying in Dunc & Dee's place, we would stay again for our next Edinburgh trip for sure! Thank you for a lovely stay!

(The best cookies we had while visiting Scotland). Their place is amazingly quiet and safe for its super close proximity to the royal mile and many other tourist attractions. We walked everywhere! It was more than we ever could have hoped for in a home for 5 days. And a great location for all of the places we wanted to explore while there. We got so exhausted being tourists all day, that it was really nice to come home, relax on the couch, and watch some Netflix with a glass of wine in the evening. 

BONUSES:
1) The living room window has a stunning view of Calton Hill!
2) The apartment is decorated with very trendy/well designed posters & illustrations (which was a huge perk for the graphic designer/art nerd in me)!
3) Maybe silly, but practical to note, the water pressure/temp in the shower is awesome after a long day exploring! 
4) The kitchen is painted in the cheeriest blue color, and sure to put you in a good mood first thing in the morning!

Situated half way down the Royal Mile, we were in a few minutes walk from everything we wanted to see.

The flat is cozy and charmingly decorated. Everything is neat and clean and comfortable. While being located in a busy part of town, the bedroom is surprisingly quiet at night. Duncan and Daniela really go beyond the average host, providing you with a nice selection of toiletries, breakfast foods, and snacks. Duncan was even able to coordinate an earlier check in time for us. It couldn't have been a more pleasant experience. 
 
The flat is located up a spiral staircase, so keep in mind you will have a climb. Americans should take note that the floors are numbered differently in Britain, so a second floor apartment will be on the third floor for us. LOL 

There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about this rental.  I highly recommend and will definitely book again.",5

We could not have been more happy with our hosts, or our location.

One thing to note.  If you are a larger person, you may find it hard to navigate the separate Water Closet (toilet room) which is very small and separate from the shower room that is shown in the pictures.  This is not a bad mark against the location or the hosts, just a note for those that might be bigger than ""average"" size.",5

The apartment is centrally located and the views are incredible. It's a short walk to the castle. The apartment is spacious and comfortable. We will definitely be back here in the coming years. ,5

The apartment was in the perfect location for exploring the city for the first time.  It was just off the Royal Mile and was quiet even though we felt like it was right in the middle of things.

It is an ideal location, basically on the Royal Mile with a nice window view for people watching. Many shops, restaurants and sites are within a few blocks and it was very close to the train station.. The apartment is clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well appointed with everything we needed for cooking in, which we did on two of our nights---this was also a good time to watch our favorite shows on Netflix. 

The shower and toilet are in separate rooms which is handy. The toilet room is pretty snug   The shower is very nice with good water pressure. We wished the water was a bit hotter---not sure if that is a Scotland thing or just could have increased the temperature. The bed is a double
which is smaller than we are
Used to, but was quite comfortable with plenty of pillows provided. 

Duncan and Daniela were excellent to work with and very responsive to our needs. We pushed a wrong button on the thermostat which disconnected something and as soon as we let Duncan know he was right over to fix it. The flowers and Proseco on arrival were certainly a nice touch.  All in all, would recommend this flat",5

The location is so central and the apartment is the perfect size, really cosy but has everything you could need. The list of recommendations that Duncan sent was great too, we used it all the time. Check in and out was really easy. Another recommendation would be to go to North Berwick for the day (half an hour on the train from Edinburgh Waverley), it's a beautiful seaside town with lovely beach walks. Would definitely stay in the apartment again if we come back to Edinburgh!",5

You are steps from the Royal Mile and so many great restaurants and pubs. The hosts gave us tons of recommendations and really was there anytime that we had a question.

Location of the aprtment is just off the Royal Mile so it's walking distance to all the main attractions. But a short walk to the tram and the main train station should you want or  to use public transportation. 
Highly reccomend! ",5

My sister said it was the best AirBnB place she had ever stayed in because of how very considerate and thoughtful our hosts were throughout our stay with little touches that just made it a wonderful visit. I honestly don't think I could find a fault with this apartment and our treatment, so thanks very much and we would love to stay again if we are ever in Edinburgh.",5

It's in a great location (just off the high street) and everything is basically in either an easy walk or bus ride (for Leith for example). 

Although it's on a pretty busy street, the bedroom is in the back the apartment and it stays reasonably quiet in the evenings (except for 1 night where I believe there was a party happening in the building).

Great hosts, they sent a bunch of lovely information about places to check out before we arrived.

Fun people watching from the window onto the below street.  Duncan and Daniela sent us loads of helpful tips ahead of time and communicated so we knew exactly where to go and what to expect.  Graeme was there to meet us despite our flight being delayed and was very friendly and helpful at explaining everything.   This was much appreciated coming off a long flight with an infant.

The kitchen has everything you could need to cook a full meal, and the bathroom finishes are modern and sleek. The shower is great! With the wall-mounted TV and satellite channels we felt like we were staying in a boutique hotel. The bedroom is in the back of the apartment so we were not bothered by street noise. Actually, even in the evening when we were in the living room we did not notice a lot of street noise. There are no bars or late night restaurants in the immediate vicinity. The famous World's End pub is down the street on the corner but their entrance and exit is onto the Royal Mile. Duncan, who met us, was lovely. He helped us park our car (you don't need a car in Edinburgh by the way) and left us champagne and homemade shortbread as welcome gifts. Amazing place in an amazing city! ",5

My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights on the last weekend of our tour of Scotland. Daniela met us to go over everything and was a pleasure to talk to. Daniela and Duncan sent a list of their favorite places shortly after our reservation was confirmed, so we were able to consider those in our planning. This place is so stylish and in the middle of Edinburgh! It is in walking distance to the castle and is practically on the Royal Mile. There are a ton of restaurants, pubs, and tourist attractions near by. We were able to get tea from many close by cafes and then jump on the double-decker tour bus to head to all of our destinations. The entire city is filled with old architecture, and this apartment is no exception. The inside is so cute and modern, and the outside is an old stone building. The only negative to this apartment is the noise (if you are sensitive to that). We embraced being in the middle of the city with the late noise from the street and the seagulls. It really just made the experience that much more exciting. We stayed in a few Airbnb places during our trip and this one was our favorite! We definitely did not want to leave after staying here!!

It's less than a 10-minute walk from the train station with cafes just below the apartment (try Wee Bite from some affordable, huge rolls, baguettes and paninis plus good coffee!). A local grocer's is just across the road (you can see it from the living room window), and Sainsbury's and Tesco is about 7 mins away.

The flat is on the 2nd floor, up a circular staircase.  It was warm and cosy, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was modern with a good-pressure shower (please note there's a separate toilet).

It has a fully equipped kitchen with basics such as olive oil, salt and peper (I cooked at least one meal each day). I really appreciated the welcome starter pack of milk, homemade shortbread and Prosecco. 

Dunc & Dee laid out clear instructions for daily living in the flat and gave some excellent restaurant recommendations.

I'll go further into detail - everything is exactly as described in the listing (but somehow even better) and if you're looking for the cosiest vibes - this is it. 

Every little detail: From the towels to the linen to the utensils are so well thought out. Even the shower door opens inside and outside which is so convenient!! 

The location is absolutely fab, you can explore all the sights in Edinburgh by foot from the apartment. The hosts also prepare a very thoughtful guide of places you may want to visit. 

If I was being super nit picky I think the communication was a little slow but it wasn't much of an issue to me.

The apartment was compact, light & airy, very clean & had comfortable, relaxed, homely feel about it. 
All the appliances were in good working order, the shower was powerful, the bed/pillows were super comfy & the towels/bedlinen were of good quality.

Dunc & Dee are also extremely attentive hosts and it is clear how much they care about making your stay as enjoyable and comfortable as possible (including extra special touches like chilled prosecco and tasty shortbread waiting for you on arrival üôÇ). Where they shone as hosts for us though, was how they proactively communicated with us once they were made aware of some isolated late night disturbances by their neighbours (which were outside any of our control) and how they kept us informed of what was being done to address it throughout.

The location just off Princes Street makes it for being able to walk to all the city sites and it is easy to catch a bus or tram to those further afield.

Before arriving to Edinburgh we received Dunc & Dee‚Äôs recommendations about places to eat and drink. Most of the bars and restaurants we visited were included in Dunc & Dee‚Äôs suggested list and all of them were fantastic and not touristy.

There was good WiFi and even a Bluetooth speaker. I don't  think I heard any noise from neighbours during our 3 day stay.

Dunc managed to get us checked in a little earlier (someone else was in the flat that day). The flat was lovely, stylish and really cosy. I was wondering if it would be warm enough for January, but the heating was easy to control and we needed to turn it down at some points! We also very much appreciated the prosecco and chocolates! A great touch to make us feel welcome. 

The flat is right in the heart of the main historical street of Edinburgh, so you walk out of the flat and are immediately in the thick of it. It's a great base to explore from! The shower is also amazing and really powerful.

The prosecco and shortbread waiting for us on our arrival were delicious!
We had such great recommendations from Dunc - Holyrood 9A for burgers and Urban Angel for brunch were particular faves. Having Mimi's Bakehouse around the corner was a bit dangerous though! We couldn't help but pop in most days for a sweet treat!

Its central location in Edinburgh's Old Town meant it was a safe, quick walk to pretty much everywhere, which was extremely convenient especially in the evenings since it meant a great pub was never far away so we could easily relax for a bit after long days exploring the city before heading back out at night.

The flat is beautifully-supplied, perfect for two people on a weekend break. There were some lovely touches like fresh flowers, a bottle of bubbles, fresh coffee, nice toiletries and so forth. The space is well-designed and modern and felt more like a self-catering hotel in many ways. 

Duncan was on hand over the weekend but never intrusive. He checked in once to make sure all was well and when we had a run-in with the smoke alarm, called straight back.

The other benefit of the flat is the location. It's in a great part of Old Town, not far from fun bars and restaurants but equally no more than 20 minutes walk from any of the main sites.

I was impressed with the fact that it had tea, coffee, milk etc in the kitchen and Duncan had also biscuits, fruit and a nice bottle of bubbly for us to enjoy.

Duncan was there to greet us and he was very friendly and had lots of useful information to give us regarding the best places to eat and drink.  We used all his recommendations and were not disappointed.  The location was excellent although be aware that the street is very busy so there can be a lot of noise however as the bedroom is at the back this was not a problem for sleeping.  I would thoroughly recommend this accommodation to my friends and family.  We used the tram from the airport to Princess Street ¬£8.00 return per person and only takes 35 minutes and runs every 8-12 minutes the drawback was the walk to the apartment is a good 15-20 minutes some of which is up hill, obviously walking back was a lot easier.  This will not be a problem if you are using a cab.  The apartment is situated near the palace end of the Royal Mile but the City is not large and walking around is very easy although hilly.",5

Just minutes from the Waverly train station and in the middle of the castle and Holyrood palace - this was a perfect base to explore Old Town, and, being so near to the bridge across to New Town, the perfect base for pretty much most things! 

The house is also kept in great condition, and there were so many small touches like fruit, tea, laundry stuff, so that it really did feel like home the whole time we were staying there. Wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else!

Right from our booking Daniela and Duncan were brilliant. Within about 30 minutes of booking I'd had 3 emails with help on places to eat, things to do and how we were going to get the keys. I also had several other emails between my booking and our actual stay checking things were still ok and did we need anymore help, I couldn't have asked for more.  On the actual day we got delayed which meant we weren't planned to arrive until around 22:30 but Daniela was still there to meet us and explain everything.  The apartment itself was great had everything we needed, really close to the sights but still nice and peaceful.  All the essentials were also included along with a bottle of bubbles which was a nice extra touch. The wifi was really quick and lots of a helpful books and maps available to help plan our trip. Even during our stay Daniela was sending texts to make sure we were ok.

669,Idyllic Cottage in the heart of The South Downs," Cottages for Rent in Haslemere, Surrey England, United Kingdom ",Natacha,Vicki,"I booked this stay as a surprise gift for my parents, and this is what they have asked me to post:

It comes as no surprise, reading others' reviews, that our overnight stay in The Old Bakery was going to exceed our expectations, and so it did. It was a gift for us from our daughters, who had also arranged for a private meal for my wife and me cooked and served in the lovely dining room upstairs in the converted barn. We arrived by car mid-afternoon and were greeted by Natacha, who is lovely, although even without the personal touch, access to the converted barn was no problem. We unpacked, found our bearings, then took a 15 min walk (muddy, but manageable!) through the woods to the nearby pub, which is just idyllic - in fact the whole area is so quintessentially English that it should warm the cockles of anyone's heart. That evening we felt very special relaxing over a glorious meal in the dining room back in The Old Bakery, prepared personally for us by Natacha and ably assisted by her lovely 13 year old daughter. It was lovely getting to know them, and although not a service she traditionally offers, it might be worth asking offline if she'd do it again. Certainly her culinary skills, her care of service and her warmth of hospitality are what makes a stay at The Old Bakery an absolute must. We had to get on the road shortly after a quick breakfast the next day, but would definitely look to return, not only to relax in the environs, but also to enjoy the warmth and hospitality that makes the place so special. Thank you natacha, from Peter and Lizzie Daniell xxx",5

The cake was BEAUTIFUL and so delicious and all of our guests commented on how lovely it was.

There's a studio upstairs apparently but I think its more like a room because from downstairs you can hear so much movement above (the ceiling is clearly very thin). I also was actually unaware there was someone in the roof for quite some time, but what made it crystal clear was the extremely loud snoring that reverberated the room at 00:30 am and unfortunately kept me up, on both nights! 
If it was not for the snoring and misleading categorization, I would have given it a higher rating as the place was nice but those two elements unfortunately spoilt the experience a bit.",3

964,Budget private room with ensuite - city centre," Flats for Rent in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom ",Dromor,David,"So the location is fantastic. Very close to train station and city centre. Room was clean and very modern. It was quiet too.

Two things should be stated however. There is no internet. They say you can get city wifi, but that's a bit misleading. It's blatantly out of range. So I think they should represent that a bit clearer.

Second is that the kitchen is not really a kitchen. It's more of a closet with a compact refrigerator and microwave shared by the whole building. And they don't have enough cutlery (only knives?) and not enough dish soap. And I requested more, and they said they'd restock it but never did.

So don't count on any cooking or internet. Apart from that, it's a great price for the location. Just plan to use data and eat microwave meals.

ps. checkin was smooth, but you can't take a key. It's chained to the lock box. It made things a little inconvenient, but was still doable.",3

I won‚Äôt nitpick here but the one thing I think needs to be mentioned is that wifi was not only not available, the free public wifi mentioned is less than off and on - the nearest place you‚Äôll find it is in the downtown area several minutes walk away. So if you need wifi in your room this probably isn‚Äôt the Airbnb option for you. If you need a decent place to stay and plan on being out all day while you‚Äôre in Cardiff, then it‚Äôs just fine.

Wouldn‚Äôt let us clean or provide anything without paying. Took two weeks of pestering for them to provide a single sponge. Defrosted the fridge all day with no warning while our food was in it. Microwave broke and it took a week to be replaced. Extremely small for the amount of people, especially the kitchenette which fits max 1 and has only one mini-fridge for 5 rooms. Atrocious customer service. Wont respond or will just say ‚Äòsorry for inconvenience‚Äô and do nothing until you pester/ complain.

We did pay a much higher price due to it being increased as it was the weekend of a rugby match but at its usual price it is very good value. It is a shared building and our room was by the front door so there was some noisy guests coming in and out but not much can be done about that and it wasn‚Äôt too bad. There are marks on the walls and a bit of decoration TLC wouldn‚Äôt go astray but I was aware of that before booking. Also we had to buy toilet paper as there wasn‚Äôt enough provided which was a little inconvenient.

The system with the keys chained to the lockbox is annoying and fiddly and not fun when it's dark and raining and you are having to shine your phone flashlight on the box with one hand and try and shove the chain and its key back in the box with the other, with no hand left to hold an umbrella to protect you form the elements. Owner changed the code for the front door lockbox halfway through the day and didn't inform us, which left us standing in the rain fiddling with the lockbox for ages until we called the owner and were given the new code. Found the new code had been slipped under our door on a piece of paper when we got back to our room, but obviously this happened after we had already left for the day so we had no way of knowing this. This kind of thing should obviously be communicated through the airbnb app first thing.

Quite disappointed Dromor was not able to send someone on their ‚Äúteam‚Äù in emergency situation, or find a solution more quickly. Communication was slow at times regarding issues, since the host needs to consult manager and slow to update. I did ask for partial refund and eventually received with the help of Airbnb support as Dromor initially did not reply to my request. Have to knock off 2 stars for the broken lock incident, inefficient and slow communication.",3

I didn't really care much but there's some works by the house, so expect noise in the morning. 

Communication was honestly bad, most of the time with automatic messages and the worst thing was the first day I went out and after back someone put my padlock code and opened my door, nothing bad happened but I had over 2k pounds in pc components inside.

The construction next to it is horrible‚Ä¶ it might last for a year :/ If there are more guests in the house you can hear everything, slamming doors, or the toilets flushing.

1124,Budget private room with ensuite - city centre," Flats for Rent in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom ",Dromor,Anne,"Positives:
- The location is very central, even if the street itself is a bit dodgy (we had no problems whatsoever though).
- The bed and the bathroom are clean.
- It was very affordable, which for graduation week was a big exception, so we are grateful for that.
- Communication was pretty easy, quick responses.

Negatives:
- The noise. Of course there's the construction, which to be fair they do warn you about, but it starts at 7:30 each morning (including Sunday!) so it is something to take into account. But there's also the noise during the night, mainly from the emergency light in the room and other people fiddling with the keys and the front door (we had Room 1, which is right next to the front door). The walls and floors sounded quite thin too. Then there's the seagulls of course, but that's a Cardiff-wide problem (believe me, I've lived there).
- The photos conveniently do not show the mystery stains on the carpet and walls. Like I said, the most important parts (bed & bathroom) are clean, but really the room could use a deep clean and a coat of paint.
- The shower is almost impossible to turn on/off. The water was very hot as well, not good for your skin hot. Good water pressure, though.
- Kind of annoying that you have to get each key from the lock box every time and put it back. This again adds to the noise and takes quite a bit of time.

We didn't make use of the kitchen (in fact, we never even when there), so we can't comment on that.

Overall, just know what you're getting into and what is important to you as a traveller!",4

1145,Budget private room with ensuite - city centre," Flats for Rent in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom ",Dromor,Richard,"We had the same experience as many others - we arrived and the room was filthy, bed was stained, full bins and dirty towels on the floor. We contacted the host, who just said he'd look into it. We kept messaging to find out when the cleaner could arrive, or if we'd have to find other accommodation.
Eventually, he responded to let us know the cleaner would be there the next day.
We ended up having to walk around the city to search for a hotel for the first night, which cost over twice the amount paid for two nights here (the cheapest available in the city at the time!)
Airbnb only refunded us the cost of this room, despite us having to spend twice that amount finding an alternative place to stay.
The following day, we unfortunately had to stay here as there were no other options available in cardiff due to a concert.
The room was eventually cleaned, which we were informed of after 3pm, the intended check-in time from the day before.

Room was not specified as the one in the picture when I booked but it was satisfactory. Very clean and good value for money but needs decorating. However the location is pretty ropey being next to a large, dark and exposed development site and as I was travelling alone with my 13yr old son I felt a bit exposed in the ground floor room.

My issue with this stay is the misleading listing information, the unhelpful host and the fact that host blatantly lied to me!
We booked this Airbnb because in the listing and in the photos it stated that there would be a dressing table or dedicated workspace as I needed to work from the room during my stay.
Unfortunately upon arrival there was no table/ workspace in the room so I contacted the host and asked to change rooms. They said they were fully booked however another room with a desk sat empty for 5 days!!

This resulted in me having to work from the bed all week which was not only uncomfortable but also very unprofessional when I was on video calls with clients!

The room was very clean, if a little shabby in places and the bed was comfy, although we only had one pillow each. The bathroom was a good size and had a heated towel rack as a bonus. 

Checkin in and out was very easy as they used a key and lockbox system and we were messaged the combinations to the front door and our room beforehand. Not having a key to take with us meant there was no chance of us losing it which worked out quite well. I didn't get a chance to use the (very small) communal kitchen so I can't really comment on how that was.

The only small issues we had were the lack of hand soap in the bathroom to wash our hands with, despite being provided with a tiny bottle of shampoo/body wash, the shower head leaked when the pressure was high and the blinds were not attached correctly and they could have injured me when they fell.",4

This is basically a hostel with private rooms (fair enough)‚Ä¶ except the fact that when we walked in, the floor was covered in deep dark stains and looked unhygienic. The main light didnt work so we were forced to use a small lamp provided and our phone torches. The bathroom door didnt always close. The shower fell apart in our hands, and there were (what looked to be) washed out blood stains on the bedding. NOT TO MENTION the ¬£35 cleaning fee paid just to find half eaten sweets on the floor.
The location is perfect once you actually find it. The number 13 is nextdoor to number 1 right at the end of the small cul-de-sac next to a big building site. Its right next to central train station which was an advantage.

It's clean and nicely furnished. The room has a perfect size for a long weekend getaway. And the area around the apartment is alright, nothing to be scared about and actually kinda cute with the small houses. Several tube stops around the building (about 10-15 minute walk) give you a good access to central London. The only thing which might be a little annoying is that there's only one small bathroom for sometimes six people. If the timing between you and the other guests is bad it might annoy a little. (had the situation twice, which was not too bad but I just wanted other guests to know) and the room number 1 is faced towards the street which is a bit noisy so if you're a light sleeper better book room number 3 which i guess is faced towards some backyard. All in all the apartment and communication with Nishma was good and we had almost nothing to complain (except the bathroom situation). We had a good time in London. Thank you. ",4

Bedroom and kitchen area were clean but the bathroom was dirty and the shower drain was blocked with some of it detached, causing the water to drain very slowly and leaving a tray full of hairs and dirt of other guests. I don't believe the host lives in the apartment so keeping an eye on cleanliness may not be so easy and after mentioning the condition to the host, I was told it would be rectified the next morning.

The apartment was well secured but easy to follow from instructions send to us. The place was a little small, but it had a nice look and the whole place was kept clean. It pretty much was what we'd read and seen before coming over. It was also nice to meet some of the other tenants staying there.

Kilburn isn‚Äôt the nicest area of London, but the underground station was close to the Airbnb and from there it was a quick ride to the city center. It was quite noisy because the room faces the street, however we had no problems sleeping at night. There‚Äôs a supermarket right across the street which was great for us. Since the other rooms were also occupied during our stay, the bathroom was quite dirty when we arrived. However, it was cleaned shortly after which we really appreaciated. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the room for a romantic getaway, simply because the area isn‚Äôt great and the room isn‚Äôt laid out for that, but it was great for me and my friend. Nishma was great at communicating check-in and check-out details, the whole system is quite high tech, but actually very convenient.",4

While a little farther out from the main city, it is only a train ride away to all the main stations after about a 10 minute walk. Two of the rooms do face the street, so bringing earplugs may be a good idea just to block out some of the traffic. Nishma was incredibly quick at responding and ensuring that we had the best time while we were there.",5

This was the first time we visited London, so our days were always pretty busy. The flat looks just like the photos; it is clean, very well organized, and has everything you need.

Nishma was a great host and responded to us very promptly. The only issue we had was with the toilet one day and Nishma responded right away and got someone to come fix it within 12 hours which was fantastic! 

The flat was a little bit further from Central London than we expected, but this wasn't a big deal. It is about a 10min walk to the Tube station and then another 10-15min Tube ride into Central London. Additionally, there is an Overground station about a 10min walk away. 

There are many restaurants and cafes located very close to the flat, and there is a grocery store across the street which was very convenient! 

Overall, like I said the flat is a great place to stay if you're just looking for a place to sleep as there is not a dining room or a living room so the majority of your time will be spent in your bedroom! Again, this is exactly what my boyfriend and I were looking for, and we would recommend this place to others! :)",4

I was struggling to turn on the modern touch-pad stove, and she quickly sent someone over within 6 minutes. There are 3 rooms in the flat. The room i was in gets quite noisy because it's facing a busy road, but for the value and location, you can learn to tune out the noise. There is a Tesco (grocery store) across the Street, a bus station nearby, tube station nearby and many eating places nearby. The place is spotless clean and modern; you can see that everything in the apartment is brand new. The kitchen is amazing; you don't need to bring anything in that kitchen, just your groceries. The room has everything you need, iron and ironing board, clothing hangers, towels, dry rack, cable TV, etc. There is also a washing machine and soap provided, so for the price and Zone 2, I think it's well-worth it.",5

De verzorging van het pand en de voorzieningen vonden we slecht. Zo ontbrak bijvoorbeeld het handvat van de wc-borstel, was er geen handzeep in de badkamer, zat het tapijt los in de twee hallen (waardoor √©√©n van ons meerdere keren is gestruikeld), miste de wasbak een onderdeel waardoor je zo de afvoerpijp in keek, was de spiegel in onze kamer kapot en sloot het raam in de kamer niet goed af. Verder was de woning niet zorgvuldig schoongemaakt. Zo was de douchekop bijvoorbeeld erg vies en zat er stof op de muren/deuren. Ook vonden we het gek dat het brandalarm in onze kamer was afgeschermd met plastic (waardoor hij geen rook meer kan detecteren) en hoorde we elke paar minuten een harde piep uit de keuken komen. Dit laatste hebben we aangegeven (samen met de handzeep die op was in de badkamer) toen we er achter kwamen dat de piep van de koolmonoxide meter kwam die een nieuwe batterij moest hebben. De host zei meteen iemand te sturen die beide op zou lossen, maar dit is niet gebeurd (dit terwijl de piep zo hard was dat je het overal kon horen, dus ook in bed). Tot slot is het sowieso een erg gehorige woning; je hoort de mensen in de kamer naast je praten, deuren dichtslaan, mensen lopen/stommelen, de weg waarvan je (ook als het raam dicht zit) alles op straat kan horen. 
Ondanks dit alles vonden we het bed wel erg fijn slapen, inclusief de kussens en waren we blij met de keuken (waar we overigens wel een handdoek&theedoek miste). Voor de drie nachtjes dat we er waren was het ok√©, maar ik had er niet veel langer willen blijven.",3

Aber unser Zimmer wurde frisch gereinigt, es wurde nur eine angebissene Frucht im Schrank vergessen. Frische Bettw√§sche und Handt√ºcher vorhanden.

Auch Nishmas Service war sehr gut. Bereits vor der Reise beantwortete sie innerhalb kurzer Zeit alle Fragen, die wir hatten.

Leider ging auch das unged√§mmte Fenster des Zimmers zur Stra√üe hinaus, wodurch es in der Nacht laut war. 

All in all, the flat was good for us. To the tube station Queens Park it is just 10 minutes by walking and then it takes in 15 minutes to the center. In general, the district is very nice and has many small nice restaurants. Also Nisma's service was very good. Already before the trip she answered all our questions within a short time. In the flat, we had problems with the front door and she sent us help in less than 10 minutes.

Autrement le s√©jour s‚Äôest bien d√©roul√©, nishma est une personne agr√©able et r√©active. Tout est bien organiser pour chaque chambre, le logement est s√©curis√© et place face √† un Market ouvert jusqu‚Äôa 23h et 7/7.

We needed a safe place to isolate the night before my flight back to the US, somewhere comfortable and clean, and Leman Locke was the perfect hideout to relax and try and forget about the outside world for a night. Our studio was beautiful and thoughtfully decorated, with attention to detail and excellent space planning. The coffee bar downstairs stayed open for guests to enjoy really good coffee, snacks, fresh juices, sandwiches, and friendly conversation with the staff. Our favorite part was the view of the city at sunrise and sunset. A really magical last night in London together, thanks to this place.

Roughly 200 yards from the underground station (Aldgate East). This is more like a hotel.  There is a check in desk and they can store your luggage.  The restaurant downstairs was convenient for coffee and pastries in the mornings.  The room was very clean and they provided the basics like soaps, blow dryer, iron, ironing board but also little extras like tea, coffee, milk and some candy.  The layout of the room was a bit wonky - very narrow space to get around the bed and the light switches were not obvious and in some cases just plain dumb (bathroom switch was hidden behind the bathroom door in hallway).

The place was within walking distance to restaurants, pubs, and other amenities. The apartment itself was spacious in a high rise condo quality building with a front desk and coffee bistro on the main level. Inside the apartment was a full kitchen with thoughtful details such as quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances. Marble dining table and beautiful light oak wood floors + light pink sofa. There was plenty of room for me and my husband. It is a busy area once you walk outside. Morning rush hour and a train station nearby made for tons of commuters walking to work.

There was a couple of convenience stores nearby so we cooked for breakfast/brunch and ate out for dinner. London in December is beautiful with stunning architecture and Christmas lights. Watch out for pickpockets near all of the tourist attractions (Buckingham Palace) or crowded streets.",5
1887,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Oscar,"Absolutely one of the best places I have ever stayed at in my life. I was given a room on the 18th floor and the pictures do no justice. The room seemed like an upper class midtown apartment in Manhattan with an amazing view overlooking all of London. The bed was comfy, the living and dining room were lovely and and the bathroom was spotless. The kitchen was filled with brand new technology and the TV had cable and built in Apple TV. The downstairs restaurant gave us 15% discount for eating there and the receptionist were extremely helpful. I was completely surprised by this location and wish I could book it again sometime soon but the reservations were all booked up when I tried. Honestly, if you're looking for a comfortable and trendy place to stay, don't bother looking elsewhere. Being only a 2 minute walk from the nearest station, everything was perfect. Clean, beautiful, warm and exciting are the words that come to mind when I think of my stay here. Next time I stay in London, I'll be sure to stay here.",5

Things that might bother people: the bed isn't as comfortable as it could be, and it's VERY hard to get the whole place dark at night.

It is basically run like a hotel, however you have your own apartment space. It was so comfortable and so convenient especially considering there was a washer in the flat. The bathroom is clean and roomy. The floor to ceiling windows allow a lot of natural light into
the flat making it comfortable. The pastel colors of the walls also brighten up the space that help fight off that London gloom. It was the perfect location too! Commutes on the underground to major sightseeing places took around 20 min.  The closest stop is Aldgate East and it‚Äôs literally a one minute walk away from the apartment building.

The staff were very welcoming, friendly, and accommodating - something very memorable and well appreciated. I absolutely loved the space - there is a huge window that overlooks the city and you get such pretty views on a clear, sunny day (usually in the morning, at least from my personal experience).

Deliveroo orders available, convenient Amazon Fresh up the road plus a few other shops nearby. Lots of helpful items behind reception if you need. Lots to do too, shame we didn‚Äôt have chance to engage in the advertised events (from yoga to Easter egg hunt, music and other activities). The cafe looked really nice but didn‚Äôt have time to try. 

A couple of constructive criticisms, the sofa appeared smaller (or further away) than we thought it looked in the ad, but could just be us. The TV can‚Äôt be seen from the bed, and the soap bracket in the shower was loose making it ‚Äòfun‚Äô to use ü§£.

It‚Äôs a great space and well designed. Located next to aldgate east station, it‚Äôs well connected to many places. 

Know that its surroundings are mostly office buildings and also, they do not provide daily cleaning of your room. There were some switches in the room that were not functioning but that did not take away how I impressed I was with the space I had. 

If you‚Äôre traveling solo, or like to meet new people, Leman Locke did not really have a communal area that open in the evenings. They do however have a cafe downstairs and an asian fusion resto on the first floor.",5

Although the room was satisfactory, the morning after a late night we had 5 separate knocks on our door, starting at 8.30am through to 10.00am. 

The first knock woke us up and the second knock woke us up again. 

The reason behind why, when I asked at reception was apparently there had been a problem with your systems and apparently it looked as though we‚Äôd already checked out, when we had not. 

2 of the people that came to our room asked us the same question ‚Äòto confirm our name‚Äô and 3 of the knocks appeared to be housekeeping!

I am extremely frustrated and annoyed as we were not able to check in yesterday until 16:00pm and then to have 5 knocks on our door this morning from 8.30am when check out is 11.00am is absolutely ridiculous.

Please respond to me at your earliest convenience.",1

2181,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,David,"I picked this place based on the good reviews, but my experience was quite different. When I first arrived, I discovered that the light at the doorway inside the room could not be switched off, which affected my sleep. I raised this with reception the next day, but nothing was done about it for several days. It was only fixed when I raised this yet again, which was one week into my stay. After the fix, there was some debris left on the floor, which would have been cleaned up by anyone attentive enough. I'd soon discover that this sort of tardy and incomplete service would be characteristic of this place. When I checked in, I was told that housekeeping would be done for me every Sunday - this was not done until two and a half weeks into my stay. When I wanted my bins emptied, that took a few days as well - and even then, they missed one of the bins. When housekeeping finally came, they missed out on the bins yet again. Rarely are things done to complete satisfaction in this place. It was really tiring to have to hound the receptionists for these basic services, especially after a long day of work. After two weeks, I had enough and I wanted to relocate and get a refund. However, they weren't helpful on this front at all - instead of working together with me to find a compromise, they simply pointed to the no refund clause on the Airbnb site and directed me to contact Airbnb's agents myself. I'm not sure why it fell upon me to remedy their unsatisfactory service, but at this point it didn't surprise me to receive such a response.  I suppose that most of the previous reviewers must have only stayed for shorter periods, and so such flaws are less evident. For travelers looking for longer stays, I would recommend that you look elsewhere.",3

2190,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Alex,"I booked this place for my stay in London because of its excellent location. I was first given a room on the 14th floor but due to a broken AC, I was later moved to the 9th floor. Generally speaking, the room was tidy and everything looked good. I did think that the rooms were a bit too dark for my liking and the light control was all over the place. It would also help if the AC control was closer to the bed because when it got too cold, you had to get up and walk into the living room to change the temperature but this is a minor thing. Overall, the staff was very helpful and they even let me check in ahead of the official time so that was nice.",4

2295,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Jodie,"The apartment was great - well designed and very comfy. A perfect place to stay for a few nights or longer.

A note for people staying at Leman Locke having booked via Airbnb - when you check in they will ask to pre-auth your credit card but there is no need for you to do this. It's against Airbnb's T&Cs and would mean that Leman Locke could take money straight out your account rather than going via Airbnb's proper process. 

Don't hand over your credit card upon checking in - you don't have to do it and it would compromise your rights.

The lady on the check-in desk understood and was fine when we said we wouldn't be handing over our card.",5

The service was outstanding, the staff could not be more helpful and the room far exceeded expectation. It was absolutely spotless and pristine. These apartments surprise you with their specification. The TV links to both Apple and android devices. You can stream your own Netflix, Spotify etc. Screen mirroring offers full phone functionality on the TV and in addition, apple TV is thrown in. The WiFi is excellent. The kitchen has a dishwasher, washer dryer, large fridge freezer, induction hob, oven, connection microwave oven, full recycling facilities a toaster and a kettle. The tea and coffee was actually good for once, with high quality green tea, English breakfast tea and Sainsbury's coffee bags, which was a nice added touch. The bathroom and walk in shower were great, fantastic water pressure, unlimited hot water, lovely towels, (as you would expect), but again, with a quirky added touch. Kinsey Apothecary shampoo, conditioner and body lotion on tap. Simple things, but they make a difference.

Perfect location, decent pricing, clean and organised rooms and well equipped with necessities. The service is spot on, the staff are friendly and they accommodate all my requests every time. Smooth and fast check in, except one time which was compensated with a free late check out. All in all, perfect place to stay in and would recommend to all.",5

Only issue is the quite late check in 16:00 which you can pay extra 10gbp to check in 2 hours before. Also as soon as you book they send you emails advertising their ""upgrades"", one of which is upgrade to a room with a view (as shown in the photos here) which seemed a bit cheeky. I cant really complain because they gave us a free ""upgrade"" to a room on a higher floor with the advertises view without us asking. Just something to be aware of but like I said, I would stay with them again.",5

Because the one I have booked is a bigger room and the one she give to me was a smaller room also when I booked it no one told me the room was full or anything, and then I have discussed with her and she said ok she can give me another one (literally the same room that I booked but in a high floor) and she ask me to pay extra ¬£20 for it!! the reason she give it to me was because this one is on a different floor and I was like?? Why? That‚Äôs the same room I have booked online and I have paid that particular room just because you give my room to someone else and now you give me the same room in a different floor so I have to pay extra ¬£20?

Beware of the pricing however, the upgrade may cost you more than the ¬£10 advertised (costed me double, @ ¬£20).

2595,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Jonny,"I stayed at Leman Locke in order to isolate for three days prior to an operation as advised by the hospital during the Coronavirus pandemic. The place itself was the perfect location and would be great for any visitors who are able to venture out to the nearby restaurants amd bars. However, as a guest who was staying in the room for the bulk of my stay, it lacked the required functionality I would have hoped for at that price. The main issue was the fact that the extractor fan was broken and as you are unable to open any windows in the apartment, it tended to smell of whatever you had cooked until it was time to cook another meal, resulting in a rather grim aroma. The microwave was also broken, meaning everything had to be made on the hob, contributing further to the smell. Some more minor negatives I came across were that the smart apps on the tv also didn‚Äôt work (google said a factory reset or update was needed for the tv), and there was a permanently flashing light in the bathroom ceiling, making showering feel like you were at an EDM festival. The pillows could also do with some softening up. It‚Äôs a shame as the apartment itself is very nice and beautifully furnished, but it let itself down on the more practical aspects and for that reason I don‚Äôt think I would return. Having said that, if you just plan to use it as a place to crash after long days out I would say it‚Äôs perfect.",2

The location is unbeatable as it gives you a great and fair price for what it offers and its location. If you are feeling lazy or are incapable of walking or are late for sth then you‚Äôll find in 1 min walking distance Aldgate East Tube station and in 3-5 min walking distance Aldgate Tube station. Have time on your hands, then walk within 15 mins to Tower Bridge/Tower of London. 
The room/apartment is well thought out. For example, you‚Äôll find an abundance of usb 2.0 5V ports and one european 2-Pin plug to charge all your devices without needing to buy an Adapter.
The bed is sufficient for a good rest and the sheets are clean and comfortable to the skin.
A safe is also available in the closet right beside the bed. You‚Äôll have a spacious shower and vanity area as well. 
IMO the highlight is the view and the kitchen, as you have everything at hand from pans and pots to cutlery, plates toaster and a spacious fridge.
Fitness enthusiast? Well that is also available in the basement. Currently, you‚Äôll have to reserve the gym room on an hourly basis depending on available time slots and you‚Äôll receive a card key. Its open from 6am-10pm so 16 time slots available.
There is also a cafe/bistro on reception floor with superb coffee, cakes and more.

I stayed on the sixth floor, having previously stayed on the sixteenth. The higher floor was a better layout, felt larger and more spacious, and it was a little cleaner (July 2020 vs August 2020). 

The lifts were busy and there's only two. I could see this being a problem if capacity increases before number of people in the lift! It wasn't a huge detractor and I only had to run down the stairs once!",4
2674,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Richard,Stayed for 2 days for the first time. Well appointed and thoughtfully laid out suite especially the bathroom but it all smelt musty. Don't know if it was because it had been locked up due to the virus  but I didn't bother to ask to move as I was tired on arrival. No other complaints and I would overlook this and return.  Sub note...Be care if using Whitechapel High Street NCP as it closes over the weekend (even though it's not supposed to) It took me 2 hours to get it opened on Sunday so I could get my car out and that wasn't an easy task. Many other people were caught out too. Apparently the car park is prone to vandalism too so be wary!,4

Our aircon seemed to be on a timer so kicked in at 1 am which did wake us but a call to the 24 hour reception will soon resolve this.

The interior of Leman&Locke but inside the actual apartment was also amazing and obvious that a lot of thought had gone into it. The only con I would list is the location, for someone travelling from the West Midlands, the bnb wasn‚Äôt the easiest to find and the nearest/affordable car park was a 15 minute walk which isn‚Äôt far but isn‚Äôt ideal when you‚Äôre carrying luggage which again isn‚Äôt the fault of Leman&Locke but overall, loved the place and will definitely be staying again.",4

The color & style was what attracted me to the property and it was exactly like how the photos was shown. Space was spacious for 2 and cosy to stay in.  

Love the location of the property as well, it was perfect!  1 min walk away from Aldgate East Station and footsteps away from many eateries around (Flat Iron, Poppies, Biang Biang Noddles etc) as well as the Old Spitafield Market.  

Check in & check out was a breeze and i would return to stay if i head back to London if the bed and linen is improved - mattress was pretty thin and it was hard to sleep on for so many nights; linen was crisp, good enough to keep you warm but not comfortable.",4

Our room was located on the 18th floor. We had an apartment which was decorated well with nice modern touches. There was WiFi and a small kitchen so that you could self cater if required. There was also USB ports above the plugs which was helpful. The bed was very comfortable and felt like sleeping on a cloud. The hotel is also doing a lot to be eco friendly which was also quite nice.

2911,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Zoha,"A boutique aparthotel with all the basic amenities decorated in a modern and stylish way. The hotel hosts a beautifully designed restaurant (Treves & Hyde), coffee bar and gym. The room had everything one would need - a welcome kit, an equipped kitchenette, TV with Netflix, linen, towels etc. 
Leman Locke's biggest win is its location - close to Aldgate East tube station, variety of coffee shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. However, outside of this, I wasn't pleased with my stay here - for an AirBnB Plus, I hoped to have had a better experience. 
I'm willing to overlook the fact that the host wasn't as responsive, I tried calling the hotel multiple times before my trip but no one answered the phone and it took the staff 2 days to get back to a simple question. 
I arrived for check-in around 11pm and couldn't enter the hotel as the check-in staff was preoccupied on their phone and ignored that there were four people waiting outside to enter. Rang the bell, knocked on the glass walls, just waited for them to look up- nothing worked till someone staying at the hotel actually let us into the building. 
The biggest disappointment was the room, it was not the high rise studio as pictured in the listing, instead the one I was given looked smaller and looked into apartments of two other buildings. I do expect that to happen in any hotel, but if I am booking through AirBnB Plus - I really do expect the place to look exactly like it is in the pictures. I didn't think this stay was worth the money, sadly, I won't be coming back here.",3

3020,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Ann-Kathrin,"Unsere 6 Tage in einem Apartment von ‚ÄûLeman Locke‚Äú waren sehr angenehm. Das Apartment ist f√ºr Londoner-Verh√§ltnisse sehr ger√§umig. Besonders positiv ist, dass es in dem Apartment eine K√ºchenzeile mit Herd, Ofen, K√ºhlschrank und Sp√ºlmaschine gibt. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck und Abendessen kann dadurch sowohl im oder au√üerhalb des Hotels stattfinden. Da unser Apartment im 15.Stockwerk war, hatten wir zudem einen wundervollen Ausblick!
Das Apartment an sich ist sch√∂n modern eingerichtet. Allerdings haben wir im Badezimmer unseres Apartments schon einige Verschlei√üspuren wahrnehmen k√∂nnen (z.B. Fugen verdreckt, Duschamatur besch√§digt). W√ºnschenswert w√§re es auch, wenn der Room- Service zu mindestens alle zwei, drei Tage nach dem Rechten schauen w√ºrde. 
Die Mitarbeiter des Hotels sind sehr freundlich, zuvorkommend und kommen jeder Bitte nach. Das Gep√§ck kann an der Rezeption sowohl vor dem Check-in als auch nach dem Check-out an der Rezeption gelassen werden.
Das Leman Locke ist nah an den Underground Stationen ‚ÄûAlgate East‚Äú und ‚ÄûAlgate‚Äú gelegen (ca. 5 Minuten zu Fu√ü). Super Anbindung also zu jeglichen Stationen.

Easy to check in (make sure you bring picture ID) and room was clean. My only fault, and this is completely down to preference, is the mattress was soft instead of firm, so I ended with a crick in my neck. If you prefer a soft mattress then it‚Äôd be ideal for you.

Only thing I noticed is that if you wanted a hairdryer etc you have to request one which could be quite frustrating and whilst you get free tea and coffee in the morning, there isn‚Äôt a kettle or anything in the room. 

Also in my room the air con wasn‚Äôt working and the light flashed consistently but I didn‚Äôt request it to be fixed as I was only there from 9pm-9am and it wasn‚Äôt overly hot in my room!",4

When you check in they give you coffee tokens to bring down in the morning for a free coffee which is a nice touch! 

Whilst the room was nice it was definitely
On the more simple side. Although you get coffee tokens, there‚Äôs no kettle in the room so you can only have one coffee a day in the room. There‚Äôs also no iron or hairdryer in the room which if you‚Äôre travelling light may be an issue!

The room was lovely but could have done with a fresh coat of paint and updating in the bathroom as the sink cabinet was rusty and had bits of metal sticking out. 

There is an overground right behind the hotel which is ideal for getting around. 

The room had air con and heating, and the tv had Netflix which was a lovely touch compared to normal tv channels in hotels!

Also, the air conditioning unit in our room was broken and it flashed lights during the night which wasn‚Äôt ideal when trying to sleep. Another slight inconvenience was loud noise coming from the hallway during the early hours. Final note, the bathroom door within the room would be better as an actual door rather than a slider as it didn‚Äôt seem to close fully.",3

There was also an extractor  fan in the room which was on constantly and became fairly annoying, as well as a bright, flashing smoke alarm.

A comfy bed, a clean bathroom and generally a great night sleep.
Only small issues we had was a broken AC/heating unit to which Kip provided a personal heater.
As well as being able to hear everything anyone said walking past your room, some party goers returning at 2am was an unwelcome wake up but the 24hour reception sorted it out fairly swiftly.

We were lucky to get upgraded which was a nice surprise (probably because it was a Tuesday night!).,4

My husband arrived and they would not check him in without receiving an email from me confirming this was ok together with my ID. They said that this was their policy but it does not say that on their Airbnb page and they did not mention this when i mentioned that I made the booking for my husband in the messages which they did not reply to.
After all that they put my husband in a room with no TV signal despite advertising it on Airbnb as having a smart tv! They did move him but this is not the experience you expect after a tough day and a long journey. They host should not be on Airbnb, they are a hotel and are not behaving like you expect from Airbnb Hosts. If you want a hotel then fine but if you like Airbnb , then don‚Äôt book this host .",1

Stayed for 2 nights for a wedding, very small room, very basic. We were right by the train tracks which didn‚Äôt bother us, but a public footpath too which was busy, that was annoying, however earplugs were provided. 
One thin pillow provided, small double bed.
No sockets by the mirrors so was difficult to get ready.

I had a room with a window which was great, but the slight downside is the noise outside. However, with the earplugs I slept really well and you would get street and train noise at any location like this. I would say the shower was a bit annoying, kept going hot and cold and never stayed at a regular temperature. Apart from that, everything was great.

Nothing in there that you don‚Äôt need, which I imagine contributes to the very reasonable price. It‚Äôs a good location, anywhere I needed to go was less than ¬£10 in an Uber. The only issues we had were with checking in and parking. The hotel requires ID, which isn‚Äôt the case for a lot of other places I‚Äôve stayed (if you‚Äôre not overseas of course). The only ID I had with me was a bank card that wasn‚Äôt acceptable and the hotel had no leniency on this policy. If I didn‚Äôt have another guest staying with me, who did have an ID, I think I wouldn‚Äôt have been turned away. Non of this was made clear at the time of booking, that an ID is a strict requirement, so just a heads up. Also the parking has had the 24 hour facility removed, so you have to continuously keep topping up which is a bit of a pain.",5

No real walkways. It was comically small. 2. The shelves pictured were not to scale. In reality, they were about 5"" deep, enough for keys or a glass of water but there was no storage in the room whatsoever. 3. Air con didn't work.

3580,Private double room with en suite facilities," Hotels for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Kip,Justice,"When we first arrived the room was perfect, clean and overall i was very impressed. The first night i had no complaints, the trains weren‚Äôt loud even though i had the window opened all night and i didn‚Äôt hear any noise from the neighbours either although i‚Äôve read other reviews where they could. 

Second day, my boyfriend tried to raise the blinds all the way up to let sons natural sunlight in however the blinds on one side broke off. We went to the front desk and they said it‚Äôd be looked at at 10am, we went out for breakfast and came back at 12pm. Still hadn‚Äôt been fixed, went out again and came back at around 5pm and it still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. Coming up to 6pm when we were chilling in the room then someone replaced it. They were very fast and efficient so to be honest i have no complaints. 

Next day checked out at 11, my boyfriend realised that he left his wallet on the way back so i called up and they were kind enough to keep it safe until i came back to get it. 

Overall very satisfied with my stay and wish i didn‚Äôt have to leave!",4

location was spot on - we had a party in Hackney, so being a 10min walk away was more than a blessing.

its really straightforward to find the hotel, which uses the same entrance as the Travelodge. 

Staff were really friendly and checked us in with no problem. to be honest we only really used the room to get ready and sleep, so can't comment on how things are generally through the day.

The room was really clean and had a fresh feel to it. the monochrome was a nice change - I wouldn't say it was luxury, which is what I might expect for ¬£200+ per night but the amount we paid made this really good value for money.

our room literally backed onto Hackney Central Station but you would've never known... I didn't hear a single train go past, the sound proofing seems really good.

Overall we have zero complaints and would definitely stay here again. the location is perfect for what we needed.",5

However we got a very small room without windows (not the room we had booked).  The aircon was too loud to sleep with , so it became a very hot night, giving us headaches. Addressed this afterwards and the manager refunded our stay as they realised one of the employees had made a mistake, assigning the rooms. 
However, AirBnB kept ¬£13 of that refund, despite Kip ordering a full refund. A bit disappointing that Air BnB did this, as there was no cleaning or service charge in the initial receipt.

Our room was smaller than pictured and it was loud being right by the elevator on the 3rd floor (301) but overall our stay was great! We booked super last minute so it was kind of a beggars can't be choosers situation for the room considering they were sold out for the night!

The amenities were unmatched too. There's always someone at the front desk. Someone helped fix our hot water at 3am. The front desk people are all very friendly and give great recommendations.

4090,Cove Minshull Street One Bedroom Apartment," Flats for Rent in Manchester, ., United Kingdom ",Cove Minshull Street,Eric,"Cove is a managed short term flat rental spot, also part of SACO (serviced apartments company).  This means you don't have to worry about anything and are more or less being treated to a boutique hotel experience.  If you stay for a week or more there's an optional cleaning service that will clean your place, replace sheets, towels, necessities, etc for free.  The building is access card only & there's a complimentary coffee machine in the main lobby.  There's even a 24/7 gym room!  The main lobby is staffed with one reception person at all times (at least late into the night) as well.  It's quiet the lovely building/operation.  In regards the apartment I stayed in I was quite happy with the decorations & living space.  The living room was lovely to relax in & the kitchen table was large enough to fully spread out and do tons of work on.  The kitchen had all the necessities for cooking and the bathroom was well equipped.  The bedroom was slightly tight but still comfortable nonetheless.  The location is great for general walking and getting around Manchester within 5-30 mins on foot, even quicker by taxi or public transit.  Overall I very much recommend the COVE for anyone in Manchester for a short or long term stay.",5

4093,Cove Minshull Street One Bedroom Apartment," Flats for Rent in Manchester, ., United Kingdom ",Cove Minshull Street,Francesca,"Our apartment at Cove was clean, comfortable, and in a great location.

Communication was not great. I sent the host a message via Airbnb several hours before arriving to ask if it was okay to change our check-in time. I never received a reply, not even after the fact.

There were also issues with the accuracy of the listing. While I understood that because we were booking at an aparthotel, each room might differ slightly, but I expected that the amenities would be the same in each room. A large part of the reason that we chose to stay at Cove was because we wanted a bathtub, as is shown in the photos. However, we arrived and stayed the first night in a room without a bathtub. Ideally, each type of room should have a separate listing. At the very least, the listing should contain a disclaimer about room variety.

After our first night we asked reception if we could be moved to a room with a bathtub. Michelle was incredibly kind and helpful in moving us to a new room, and even sent us a text to let us know when it was ready. 

Overall, the apartment itself was nice and reception was very friendly and helpful. However, this is an example of the issues that can arise when a company (rather than an individual) advertises on Airbnb.",4

They were not responsive when communicating via the Airbnb app but were very helpful when we found the email address for reception, so if you stay here and have questions, save time and contact them directly. We used the fitness studio on both mornings of our stay which was a really nice addition (equipped with some cardio machines, dumbbells, kettlebells, and full body weights machine). The kitchen could have been better equipped/stocked; only two glasses provided, and no cooking essentials e.g. salt, pepper, oil, that I would expect in all Airbnb flats with a kitchen. Neither of the TVs were tuned in unfortunately, but I expect that was just the flat we were assigned.

The spacious rooms and quick wifi connection allowed us to swiftly get our work done.

The kitchen had everything we needed, just bear in mind that there are no basic ingredients like oil, vinegar etc.. There are, however, tiny bags of salt and pepper, which just did the trick for our simple pasta sauce.

Apartment was tiny, not as on photos shown although I recall there may be a disclaimer on the photos. After reading other reviews I placed a request for an apartment with a bath at time of booking which was made weeks ahead. No bath which was very disappointing. Shower was low flow which was poor and made it hard to wash hair thoroughly. No light on cooker hood. Dirt along tops of kitchen cupboard j pull doors, as if grouting had been done recently. Towel rail dusty, not cleaned in a long time. Fridge barely cold. Furniture low quality, bed and pillows hard as rocks. Ibis standard but at much higher price. No 'little extras' .....only salt/pepper sachets, 2 the bags, 1 coffee bag, sugars. No washing up liquid, no wash up sponge or cloths, just a tea towel, 2 dishwasher tabs. There is a small dishwasher and a cheap kettle, toaster and microwave. 
Will not return.",3
4199,Cove Minshull Street One Bedroom Apartment," Flats for Rent in Manchester, ., United Kingdom ",Cove Minshull Street,Ben,"Don't fully believe in the pictures. The building interior is very much like a student dormitory, the room you are assigned to will greatly impact how your flat will look like. I got the one at the end of the hallway, and it had a narrow corridor with small windows, but it's alright since I only used it to sleep and I was out the entire day. The cleanliness was great though. The bathroom didn't have an exhaust fan which was strange.

I travelled with another person and they used the bedroom while I used the couch. The couch was really small which won't be comfortable at all if you are taller than 5'1. 

The location is spectacular as it is only 10~15 minute walk from the Christmas markets, main shopping areas, museums, China town, and pretty much all the main tourist locations. It's location is hidden in a street that is really quiet. I would recommend going home earlier at night as there are a lot of suspicious looking people hanging around the square close to the apartment.",4

Fully booked on AirBnB including pets and we were then asked to pay an extra ¬£35 upon checking in, for our dogs, which wasn't mentioned on the listing or in communication. It didn't feel right. To add to this, I asked about booking parking, didn't hear anything back, emailed them, didn't hear anything back, eventually got through on the day when ringing ahead before checking in to find, in fairness, that they had received my parking booking request and it was booked - but I had no idea until I chased them. I asked questions on AirBnB and I just got asked what my name was, no response. I hate giving 3/5 but the poor communication and extra we had to pay was very frustrating.

The place itself was really clean and well kept I was really impressed. All the facilities were there that could be required for two people. I admit the bedroom was rather small and not much room for storage. But, I was not at all disappointed.

Rooms a good size.  Staff extremely helpful and welcoming.  Only negatives were that the photos used are of a different apartment in the block (not on the ground floor which is where we ended up), plus the kitchen was sparsely stocked equipment wise with no plug for the sink.  The bathroom could also benefit from shower gel and soap dispensers to be more environmentally friendly, rather than single use wrapped items.  Parking is available under the building but make sure you reserve a place as there aren't many available.",3

4416,Cove Minshull Street One Bedroom Apartment," Flats for Rent in Manchester, ., United Kingdom ",Cove Minshull Street,Eva,"Impressively clean apartment with all the basic amenities needed for cooking and washing your clothes. We only stayed for a long weekend so did not use the kitchen very much, but would be fantastic for a longer stay. 

The check in process was really fast and there were always people on the front desk (more like a hotel than an air B&B). My partner uses a walking aid so the lifts were greatly appreciated.  They also let us keep our luggage behind the desk after checkout (as our train was in the evening) which was really helpful. Great location and only 5 minutes from the station. 

It is moderately expensive, but that's what you expect from the location. It was quite noisy at night, but again, that is due to the location at weekend. Not a complaint, but something to consider if travelling with children. 

There are two TV's - one in the bedroom and one in the main living area. These are not smart Tv's, so bring your own laptop if you want to want to watch streaming services such as Netflix.

Overall, we were really happy with our stay here and would come back again.",5

Clean and spacious. Modern bathroom. A well kitted kitchen, desk space to work, and the washing machine was a nice bonus. Some minor negatives: The sofabed was a little uncomfortable, the living room window didn't stay open, the bedroom windows didn't open at all making it hot in there, and the living room blind was fitted incorrectly so it didn't open fully. The pictures also probably show the nicest and lightest room in the complex, but that's not necessarily the one you're given.

The room is quite basic but does what it needs to do. That said, what we paid for the room (8 nights) I think was quite over estimated. The on-site gym is also very basic and small, I was hoping to make use of the facility often during the week but it was continually occupied. We also requested a room clean half way through the stay, and although the team changed our sheets and emptied the bins, they didn't really do much else. Not sure if I'd stay again but if anyone is traveling and working remotely or on a business trip then Cove would do nicely.",3

4596,Cove Minshull Street One Bedroom Apartment," Flats for Rent in Manchester, ., United Kingdom ",Cove Minshull Street,Soniya,"We were visiting Manchester for 2 nights, both nights were extremely noisy after 2am, could not sleep properly on both nights, which meant I was so tired the following morning and couldn't enjoy my partners birthday. Disappointed that the room wasn't the same as the listing, very misleading. The photo in the listing suggests it is street facing, ours was facing a building in the side street which was ugly to look at as it was very close to the window. The shutter for the car park was below our window so another annoying noise. The room was clean and inviting but why on earth was the room so hot! Bearing in mind it was 15 degrees outside and raining, inside we had to use both fans and it still wasn't enough, dreaded going in the shower because it made the apartment even more humid. We also had someone come into our room the first day and second, didn't see who as they left very quickly (must of heard the shower), was most likely the cleaning lady but we were not told our room would be serviced? It left me feeling very uncomfortable. Overall it was fine and clean, but would not stay again.",5

Stuart was so welcoming and friendly, offered me a drink as soon as I arrived and gave me a tour of the place. When my friend arrived a few hours later he offered us both a drink and enjoyed a whisky with us both before we headed over to the log cabin to relax for the evening.

Stuart then welcomed us into his private place near the cabins and spoke to us about his life and the local area, whilst being kind enough to share a beer and a cup of tea with us! Stuart then offered to book us a table at a local restaurant by the lake and offered us a lift to and from because of the weather. On top of all that, the cabins were really fantastic, such a unique experience and so much fun. A place that really allows you to enjoy some time alone in a very off the grid manner! Loved every minute of it and if it wasn‚Äôt good enough, Stuart made myself and my partner a fire outside the cabin, shortly after collecting us from the local restaurant! The snow made everything look even more amazing than it already is and we already can‚Äôt wait to go back in summer! Would highly recommend to anybody!",5

He was running late, so he called me and told me when I arrived which cabin was mine and to make myself at home.  I got a little lost finding the place but his neighbor Jeff flagged me down and led me to the place.  Once he got back, Stuart invited me in his private home for a pint and then asked if I wanted to go to close by pub to have a drink with some of the locals.  I of course said yes and had a blast.

The view of the forest and river is very relaxing, especially if you take an outside bath in the morning! 

Stuart was so lovely. Nothing was too much and he went out of his way to check on us, see if we needed anything and even drew us a map so we could go on a bike ride. 

There are plenty of activities to fill your day including Zipworld, hikes, Lake Vyrnwy is just down the road which has water sorts, cycling and walks.

Be conscious, you're not booking a house. This is a true, log cabin experience. It's got your usual amenities, there's WiFi if you need it, but other than letting family know we had arrived, we took advantage of the sounds of the river and the local woodpecker.

Stuart was lovely, even if we had arrived quite late in the evening. Welcoming and knowledgeable when we mentioned the weather had cancelled our plans. He made wonderful recommendations for alternative plans and was just the ideal host",5

The property could do with a deep clean as it was little dusty with cobwebs in most corners of the rooms and leaves in the outdoor shower.

Bring your own logs or you can buy some off Stuart. There was the sound of rats in the night every so often but your next to a river so it‚Äôs kind of a given. I enjoyed some wonderful baths under the stars and danced around the little fire pit into the night. Loved it and will be back again.",5

Upon arrival I loved the charm of the back-to-basics cabins but arrived to find Stuart had warmed up the cabin with a heater so was immediately very cosy! This is not a boutique glamping experience and still feels very wild which is exactly what I was looking for.  I loved the nostalgia of the enormous VCR collection and enjoyed a couple of films before turning in. My only minor complaint is that the bedsheets were a bit musty. It may well be I was the first guest of the year and the cold weather prior had affected the state of the bedding. The shower had dead leaves in it but Stuart kindly supplied a rake (!). A really quirky stay here that I hope to repeat in warmer months. The access to the nearby Lake Vyrnwy was so convenient and I had a great time. Thank you, Stuart.

The place is is cosy, mildly chilly this time of year but all fellow campers/quirky travellers should be used to these conditions. In my eyes it is worth every penny. I got to relive some of my childhood with the VCR player and the great collection of videos!

If you like glam ping, cabin life and having a different kind of experience- I loved it. The sunken outdoor bathtubs are blissful, open view bathroom is not for everyone but totally my cup of tea.

The cabins are as pictured and so much fun to explore, we took great delight in picking a video each night and even made use of the ‚Äúhalf outdoor‚Äù bathroom for one of the most peaceful baths I‚Äôve ever had, as well as the outdoor shower. The area is quiet and if the sky is clear there is an excellent view of the stars as you sit around the firepit in the evening. As we stayed in October there were many leaves and spiders about however this didn‚Äôt bother us, and there are brooms to sweep leaves away if needed. I highly recommend Stuart‚Äôs cabins for a back to basics stay, you can tell that they have all been built with love to be enjoyed by all, and they really do capture the spirit of Juhannus, even on a wet and windy day!",4

The cabins are warm (when the heaters are on) and the beds comfortable. 
The place could do with a bit of a clean and perhaps better signage as even with Stuarts directions, we found it tricky to locate.

Very accommodating yet leaves you to it as well. The character of the place is beautiful and it really speaks for itself. The wifi is a bonus, plates, cups, utensils are all provided as well as toilet paper and towels and bedding. It‚Äôs a great value for your money and if I‚Äôm honest, one night just simply isn‚Äôt enough. In the winter I would suggest taking some warm clothes; although there is heaters in the room as well as a huge choice of DVD‚Äôs, Games and more. Makes you realise how something of imagination can make you feel so at home. Would definitely reccomend. I had a significant amount of questions of where my stay was due to me posting on social media. Like I say, it speaks for itself.
Thank you again Stuart, your hospitality was just right. I hope you enjoy this journey that we all call life.

Took my boyfriend for his birthday surprise and it lived up to every expectation and more. Stuart is just so accommodating and did everything he could to make sure we had the most enjoyable time. He invited us in for a whisky and organised for us to visit the local piglet farm. We arranged before-hand for some friends to come down for the second night which Stuart made so easy and helped me arrange at just a small extra cost per person. The place itself is welcoming, cosy and just simply magical. We loved the VHS tapes and supply of games for the evenings and took full advantage of the natural beauty of Lake Vyrnwy with a bike ride & lunch by the water during the day. However, back at the Air BnB, the outdoor baths under the stars were my favourite part - a real-life movie scene. If you‚Äôre looking for a break away somewhere peaceful and unique, that is great value for money, then this is your lucky find!!! Romantic and heaps of fun, it‚Äôs got something for everyone.

We found this the most tranquil location, the river and reservoir walks are within easy reach.  This is definitely on the glamping side of camping , with a Finnish cabin feel and sauna was  a great addition , the accomodation was perfect for our needs but we are fairly easy to please. Simple accomodation but well arranged, clean fresh beds and towels provided, and if going in winter you will definitely will need to wrap up as mid September  was starting to chill. As a couple we felt it was private, and group could stay here but check the bed arrangements in advance with Stuart , there is some simple electric wall  heaters in the rooms to take the edge off as single skin cabins.  However nothing can compare to the amazing  hot baths under the shooting stars,  rainbows üåà were all on que and quite magical and we would definitely come back again very soon!",5

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs between camping and glamping, kind of rustic glamping. It isn‚Äôt posh, but quirky, wild, weird and FUN! The setting was glorious, quiet, fresh air and peaceful.
Warm cabins, fresh bedding which was a must for us. Rustic kitchen but plenty of cooking utensils, literally everything you needed it had! 
WiFi was good! TVs and VHS/DVDs everywhere, even you tube and Netflix, certainly came in handy when the kids wanted to slob out for half hour. 
Two hot baths outside overlooking the trees and river, super hot water! Then the loo with a view and extra bath was lovely with fairy lights on the ceiling. 
We had a great time :) thank you",5

Stuart is a very welcoming host and saved us when our car broke down upon leaving. Quirky, fun and fabulous stay. Google maps shows the correct location (also using Stuart's clear instructions).

Lovely area for sitting out and socialising or just listening to the birdsong and getting acquainted with a friendly robin.

Stuart was warm and welcoming and we got there a little too early and even the lady who was getting the place ready and clean was lovely and friendly . 
This place is just perfect , it has everything you could need . We have a large family so for us it was amazing to find somewhere with room for us all but that still gave us our own space . 
The rooms are just lovely and you can all sit out at night and it‚Äôs just so peaceful ! Even though Stuart‚Äôs house is down at the end of the lane you honestly feel like you are miles from anyone it‚Äôs very private .  Stuart is on hand to help with anything you need and really friendly and helpful he even brought us some water balloons for the kids to have a water fight and had a beer with us , but he doesn‚Äôt intrude either and  gives you your privacy . 
For us we loved that there are old vhs cassettes in the rooms and even though there is wifi, which we aren‚Äôt expecting we‚Äôd be happier without it , it all adds to the whole experience of getting away from everything , we played board games until late and the kids had so much fun in the outdoor baths with their costumes on . Much better than sitting ignoring each other in mobile phones ! There are lots of quirky little things around the place which we all loved , and it has its own character which makes it really cute . 
Stuart really has thought of everything , it still has a camping feel to it which I love but it‚Äôs got everything , there‚Äôs even a separate outside bath where you can see the stars and have a glass of wine and relax . 
We were really sad to leave and we will definitely be back , the girls said it was their favourite holiday ever and want to come back . 
Thank you Stuart for such an amazing stay and for being such a lovely host . I hope this place stays the same because it‚Äôs perfect üòä",5

This is my 3rd visit and each time there is something new about the place.  Stuart clearly works hard to maintain this place and listens to feedback.

Stuart is a great host.  Met us on arrival and left us to it as we had been before.  Came to check that evening if we had everything and joined us for a Beer.

4843,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sue,"You‚Äôve seen it. It‚Äôs fabulous. There are cobwebs and leaves and the odd dead moth here and there. Shabby chic is at its finest here. You book your holiday knowing this. If you think it‚Äôs anything else then you are deluded. 
If you want peace and quiet..and a little bit of magic then get on and book it. It‚Äôs magical. I‚Äôve been to the loo in the room with three walls, and it‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶. But I can‚Äôt explain why. There is a steep set of steps to get down to that particular loo but it is so worth the climb. There is another toilet but you are wasting opportunities if you don‚Äôt pay a call in, what can only be described as ‚Äòa call to the wild‚Äô.  There is the river and the forest... and there is nobody around to see you. 
It‚Äôs ridiculously basic ‚Ä¶but there is everything you need. The Husband is cooking steaks on the washing machine drum and I‚Äôve precooked the spud in the microwave which has now been added to his bbq.  
If it‚Äôs raining it‚Äôs no problem, you can be under cover on the veranda. There is another bath in the three walled bathroom so You may end up there for your twilight bath. It‚Äôs no problem, it‚Äôs still the same spectacular view. 
You could get ten people sleeping here, I reckon. It‚Äôs not for toddlers; there is a very steep slope, but if your kids are reasonably well behaved and you can trust them not to perform death defying stunts down the hill, then this place is for you. There is a double bed in one cabin, bunk beds in another and the treehouse sleeps two/three (there is a mattress on the floor- fine for a little one) There is also a sitting room with a futon in it .. another couple of bodies could crash on there. I didn‚Äôt use the Swedish sauna.  It‚Äôs not my kind of thing. But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just as good as the rest of the facilities. Honestly, a group of adults and kids on here would have a totally brilliant experience. A few bottles of wine and some good grub and you are well and truly sorted. 
You get this place to yourselves. There are no other visitors.  If there are a few of you out there with a couple of kids, some of you with extended family; this place is perfect for you. Remember the steep slope ‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶. Seriously‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs awesome !",5

No passing traffic, just the odd robin and pheasant! Stuart was very welcoming, set us up with WiFi and soon had a fire going for us for a bit of warmth outside (May) and then to cook our sausages! The bedrooms were toasty warm each with an electric heater.",4

Stuart was helpful and kind and suggested a walk around the local lake, which was breathtaking. We then paid Stuart a little extra to light us a fire and cooked burgers from the local shop.

I'd read the reviews so I knew what to expect but the huts exceeded my expectations! It is just so peaceful with only the sound of birds and the river to keep you company.
You have the option to escape it all and switch off or you can take advantage of the wifi and netflix.
I enjoyed an outside bath which was very relaxing!
Stuart is nearby if needed but he left me to it throughout my stay.",5

The accommodation itself is lovely. Stuart is a great host with lots of local connections, he called the Boathouse for us to confirm someone would be there should we want to launch our paddleboards! 
Fantastic spot, you‚Äôre not overlooked by anything with the sound of the forest and a stream below as the only background noise! The rooms are well equipped with TVs, DVDs, VHSs and even Wifi! There‚Äôs heaters and adequate bedding. The outdoor baths are an amazing experience, as someone else has said, and equally as beautiful for a morning dip with birdsong as they are under the stars. The kitchen has everything you need to whip up a nice meal. We didn‚Äôt ask about the sauna as there was that much we actually forgot! Can‚Äôt wait to return, no wonder it‚Äôs always booked.

This is the most heavenly of retreats.  Being so built into nature with the outdoor bathtubs and shower it was tranquil and peaceful.  We loved the outdoor baths, sitting in them listening to the birds sing & the stream below.  Candlelit too made this a very special nature experience.  Outdoor fire & a sauna t‚Äôboot!! Quirky and inspiring.  We loved everything about Stuarts bnb experience.  If it had more stars ‚≠êÔ∏è we would give it more.  We highly recommend this experience to anyone.

Rustic; back to nature, glamping type experience.  Cabins/bathroom/toilet/kitchen lovely and clean. Of course outdoor stuff is not so clean but I think that is more to do with being weathered and needing a couple of replacements more than anything else. Stuart a good communicator; close enough if you need anything; far away enough for privacy. Great value stay with no distractions ; even my son and his girlfriend (aged 20 and 21) enjoyed being switched off from everyday city life where everything is immediately accessible and consists of various screens that can zombify you.

The weather was around -2 in the night and we woke up to frost outside but the room was lovely and warm. Close by to Lake Vyrnwy and near by is a short walk to the waterfall, the north side of the lake.

Stuart is a welcoming and genuinely kind host and full of helpful information about the local area . Totally went above and beyond as a host and invited us in his home for a welcome drink & use of wifi (got to meet his cat Hamish too!). We had an amazing time using the outdoor bath, stargazing, watching videos from the vast selection (so much nostalgia!). We were warm in the cabins & comfy beds & duvets and wish we‚Äôd booked longer and will 100% be returning. Not difficult to find when following the clear directions on the listing, we absolutely loved the Halloween decs as well that greeted us. Great location and loved the cabins - any complaints regarding this listing (although there‚Äôs few) are clearly from people who‚Äôve never camped before so don‚Äôt know what they expected outdoor cabins. Plenty of facilities for heating food and plenty of hot water between the 4 of us. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and can‚Äôt praise Stuart enough.",5

4887,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Caroline,"Due to horrendous weather conditions, our stay was very cold wet and damp. We left early as we couldn‚Äôt take it any more. There was inadequate heating in the tree house and none in the sky pod which limited space for our family of 8. What was supposed to be a happy 50th birthday celebration turned out to be a disaster. Ideal in summer when weather is better but not in winter. We were limited for cooking as there is no oven. Nowhere to sit and eat together as the benches are outside. No locks on doors which made us feel vulnerable when going out and about for security. On the plus side, the bath with a view was nice and Stuart, the host cannot do enough for you. The heating issues need sorting if you are visiting during the winter months. Wi-Fi is provided. Make sure you ask otherwise you wont get it.",2

4890,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sasha,"This is a hard review to write because we loved our trip and definitely made the most of the place but it has lots of things that need to be mentioned to future prospective guests.

Firstly, our visit was in January, so of course it was freezing, but there‚Äôs only heating in the bedroom (which is good heating from a small machine and very welcome). So the kitchen is cold, the bathroom is cold, and the top of the skypod was completely unusable due to the cold and lack of heating. We didn‚Äôt use the bunk bed room or the treehouse room.

Secondly, the cleanliness is practically non-existent. There are webs and dirt everywhere. The fridge hadn‚Äôt been cleaned and absolutely reeked so we just kept our food outside. We had to rewash the dishes before using them and the dishcloths were dirty.

Thirdly, the huts and outside bath are more in view of Stuart‚Äôs property than we were lead to believe. However with our car parked in between we got a little more privacy.

Both baths are completely open which was our favourite part of the place. The stargazing is incredible and the hot water is very good and stayed hot.

The sauna was good. We paid for the wood which we helped Stuart get out ourselves.

The location is great for access to loads of incredible sites and waterfalls, only a short drive away. There‚Äôs only one shop in the area which is a petrol station, a takeaway and a small grocery. There‚Äôs absolutely no service around the area and no Wifi at the property (which was listed so we knew what we were in for) - great for escapism but tricky at times.

A couple really strange things I have to note are the weird halloween decorations in January, the duck chained to the bath was very odd, a severed hand and warning signs all down the entrance path (???), and oddest of all was a review of the place framed in the bathroom that was the world‚Äôs worst review so comical I had to take a photo in disbelief. It‚Äôs the only review displayed in the place and an A4 side explaining how much they hated the place. Very very confusing.

Despite all this we did have a good trip with lots of memories after we got used to the oddities of the huts.",3
4891,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Tiago,"What a fantastic little place! My wife and I celebrated our anniversary with a weekend away in Wales, staying at Stuart‚Äôs cabins. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay at and we are already planning our next visit.

When we arrived, Stuart invited us in for a drink and found out all sorts of interesting things about him! Very welcoming and warm host.

The cabins, as most people have stated in their reviews, are basic but warm. The kitchen has a microwave, hob, kettle.
We used the sauna on our last evening and it was a really nice way to relax and defrost after a cold day out.

The highlight of the trip: the outdoor bath!
The first evening we got there all the pipes were frozen so we were quite skeptical about it all, but as the sun rose the pipes thawed and we were able to try it out.
DIVINE. The water was so warm (it can get quite scalding actually!) and you could just lie there listening to the birds and the river. We loved it and already miss it.",5

Don‚Äôt expect luxury. If that‚Äôs what u want look elsewhere but for a back to nature break and a chance to unwind and be tech free then give it a go. 
The heaters in the rooms are enough, the water in the outdoor shower/bath is hot and there is a small kitchen (no oven) that does the job! The supply of Old Skool VHS is brilliant! Nostalgia at its best!

We came here in October and the cabins were so warm on arrival and all while we was there, wish we took an electric blanket for when we got into bed, 
The shower and bath was amazing with red hot boiling water so be careful, the cabins were all clean and tidy, we took our own quilts and pillows so extra comfy, the fire we kept going all night and even cooked on the fire, 

The kitchen is perfect, yes the pots are used and may not be up to everyone‚Äôs standards but clean them and use foil what‚Äôs the problem üôÇ, cooker was perfect to make tea and breakfast everyday while we was there and at night we used the fire to cook, 

Stuart met us on arrival and was super easy going doing his own thing, all the little things around the cabins are amazing you find new things every minute, 

Just an hour away from Barmouth bay which I would recommend to anyone that‚Äôs staying but please leave to come back while it‚Äôs light because the roads are dangerous around llandywnn, 

Stuart your cabins are amazing and the story behind them are interesting, it was nice talking to you and spending time at your air bnb, thank you again and see you soon,

4912,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Steven,"This place was perfect for a real nice quick get away. Just tucked away town a country lane in a beautiful part over the county.
Stuart gave me a warm welcome and offered a beer after a long drive. Fire wood was offered for ¬£7 which kept me going all night. 
This place was great for me and my dog to escape form London and get away form everyone . I think this can cater for 1 - 10 people? The cabins are old school and rustic and all look made by hand as  a hobby. But are completely suitable for purpose, if was a cold evening but the cabin was kept nice and warm.
You have a 2/3 cabins to relax and enjoy the scenery in with a selection of sofa beds, armchairs and classic dvds and video tapes available. 
The kitchen was only small but done the job, it is fully furnished with cooking equipment and a fridge that I filled with beer.
I only used the the microwave and used the open fire outside to cook my dinner on.
The outside shower, and start gazing baths were interesting to say the least. I loved the idea of them but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. 
I only stayed one night but would of been more than happy to stay more if I had the chance. This is more of a ‚Äúglamping‚Äù establishment and was exactly what I was after. You could ask for bay more for you money at all. I stayed in a travel lodge the next night which I feel was a step down üòÇ
I would recommend *****",5
4913,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,A,"Pros:
1. Warm and welcoming host.
2. Excellent location, although you must read host's instructions to reach the place.
Perfect for walking trips. Beautiful lake and waterfall trek nearby. 
3. Lots of quirks and special additions, eg. Massive range of movies, Treehouse, sauna, 2x open bath tubs, instant hot running water, basic amenities, secluded enough, running river close by. 

Cons:
1. The place lacked a basic level of cleanliness. The remainder of people's meals in the microwave, grease around the stove, filty hand basins, unswept patios. That said, the toilet bowls were clean and the rooms were tidy.
2. The place comes up as ¬£35/night on Airbnb, which is a little misleading, because as soon as you add an adult it goes up by ¬£20/night and then there's another ¬£10 Airbnb charge.
3. There was a mention of a Sauna, but no mention of extra cost for wood, except for in the reviews. Reviews said ¬£5 extra for wood. We were charged ¬£7 extra 'due to wood prices going up'.",4
4914,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Lyn,"We spent our wedding anniversary weekend here and it was wonderful.  It‚Äôs not just somewhere to stay it‚Äôs a fun, back to nature, wild, quirky experience.  I can imagine it‚Äôs extra gorgeous in the summer. The ‚Äòin the open bathing‚Äô experience being the best of it.  We‚Äôve never been so clean!! We stayed in the main bedroom and with the electric wall heater it was quite snug. I can imagine the tree house may be a bit cooler though in October.  The quirky decor is fun. There is a huge choice of VHS video films and dvds to watch on the TV‚Äôs come late evening but daytime it‚Äôs just gorgeous to take in the wild outdoor wilderness that surrounds you.  The sound of the flowing river below, the birds, trees and nature.  Fill the bath just before Dawn with piping hot water and lie and wait for the Dawn chorus and watch the sun rise. Or at night gaze at the stars.. Priceless!!  Obviously it‚Äôs a bit grubby, dusty, covered in cobwebs, mini beasts etc but it‚Äôs bound to be.. that‚Äôs the whole point!! pink fluffy fussy folk may sadly not appreciate it!! We loved it!!  Very little phone signal and internet (which actually adds to the relaxation). Stuart is the perfect host.. very helpful and friendly.. we shared a drink at his gorgeous home which is next door but far away enough from the huts for privacy.  A visit to the nearby huge gorgeous lake is a must. We can highly recommend Stuart‚Äôs place. Great value for money too.",5
4915,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Ian,Great stay at Stuart‚Äôs place. Really friendly welcome from Stuart and even had a bad experience with guests the previous night but still very welcoming and we shared a drink. Fantastic location and super quiet. Quirky and unusual accommodation just as described. Only there for one night and didn‚Äôt use sauna and bath but they were there if I had wanted too. Loads of videos and treated myself to Point Break! Will stay again when in the area. Thanks,5

4917,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Jordan,"I had a nice stay here with my friends after hiking snowdon on the weekend. It was pretty well equipped with cooking and bbq utensils, lots of old tvs and huge movie selection, and few board games. You could buy a large bucket of wood for a ¬£5 which would last you a night, and he offered to rent us some of his bikes if that's what you're into. Didn't have any signal on vodaphone but EE seemed to have some service. There was heaters in the bedrooms although the construction of the cabins weren't insulated. The tree house bedroom was too cold for us to sleep in October. Clean towels and linen so no complaints there.  The tree house was was quite close to the owners house and the entire airbnb area wasnt very secluded so might not be the best choice for a romantic holiday. I stayed with a few mates so we didn't have an issue with that. The outside bath was in complete view through the window of his house so I wouldn't want to be in the nude! We really enjoyed the bathtub and toilet overlooking the forest though. It would have been nice if there was some hedge or a fence to give the place a bit more privacy, I've found this the case with allot of airbnb cabins I've stayed in that they are not very secluded from the owner's house. The suana room was locked and wasn't mentioned upon arrival. I remembered there was supposed to be a suana on the second day and Stuart explained that he had some guests previously that made a mess with essential oils or something so if you want to use the suana you need to ask Stuart to come down to unlock the room, light the fire and explain how to use the suana properly. Bit of a shame as I would have preferred to have been explained and have access to the suana upon arrival. It would be nice to have a suana at 12 o'clock at night without having to go through the entire process. You might want to bring your own drinking water as the tap water he said wasn't for drinking. There was drinking water provided in a large plastic container which tasted clean to me but not sure of its source and how long its been sitting there, sure its fine though. Enjoyed the stars and fire pit at night, and the fairy lights and candles were a nice touch. Good value and a nice  alternative to camping. Thanks for having us.",3
4918,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Asma,"Absolutely fantastic location very close to lake vyrnwy, the sat nwb location takes you very near the vicinity but you would need assistance after that.
Stuart was very helpful, stay easy comfortable with quirky facilities, if your looking for something different and love nature it ticks the boxes.",5
4919,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Diane,"Ok true reflection of our 3 day break. From the very start Stuart was welcoming, friendly and very happy to share his home with us. Is this for the faint hearted‚Ä¶ no, but everything was accurate as per the listing. This is a true back to nature experience ( but with little extras) where else can you stay in a treehouse that has running hot water, usb plugs, and kitchen utilities such as fridge and microwave. From immediate arrival we completely switched off, having little phone signal and internet makes it even more relaxing. Sitting under the stars, hearing the river flow below was just what was needed. Are there cobwebs and spiders YES but what do you expect!! Stuart has made the place very special and unique, everyday you noticed something else quirky around the site. Ideal place to escape and go back to basics. Attempted to watch the numerous videos available but to be honest so much fresh air just made us fall fast asleep soon as our head hit the pillows. Stuart thank you for being so welcoming helping us out when needed and giving us privacy was really appreciated. Look forward to seeing you again soon.",5

Honestly our stay couldn't of been better. We were able to invite extra friends for one night and it was so perfect. Sauna was beautiful and omg the scenery! Very peaceful location. Had a wonderful few nights here! Very warm and toasty. AND best shower of my life, I would come back just for the shower.",5
4922,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sadie,"This was a fantastic spot for a weekend getaway but really wished we could have stayed longer! The cabins are set at the top edge of a valley between bracken and trees and just a five minute drive from Lake Vyrnwy, where you can rent canoes, kayaks, SUPs, etc. 
Stuart was a great host, and even came to light a fire for us in the evening (well worth the extra ¬£5!). The rooms were well equipped with radiators, bedding and even TVs and VHS! 
Our favourite part about the accommodation was definitely the outdoor bath in the morning, accompanied by the sound of the river flowing in the valley and the birds in the surrounding trees and greenery.",5
4923,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Celia,"Stuart has an amazing, established setting for anyone who loves life.

4924,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Natalie,"If you're looking for a quirky, rustic, cabin in the woods (or should I say several cabins all to yourselves) complete with out door bath and sauna this is the place for you. You'll be sharing the site with a three legged cat called Hamish, numerous rubber ducks and the odd spider. The setting is gorgeous, you can go visit the lake down the road (complete with impressive dam and sculptures) and have all sorts of adventures if you use it as a base to go white water rafting or to the various zip world centres as we did. Stuart always arrived at just  the right moment to light the fire or get the sauna going  (just let him know when you want it) and then he will go off and leave you to enjoy the place.",5
4925,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Ian,"Just spent two nights at Stuart‚Äôs cabins and have had a tremendous time! So relaxing the setting is superb the views stunning the first night there we had clear skies and the most spectacular star views it is hard to put into words especially when in the outdoor bath with a drink and taking it all in,really beautiful! My wife and I likened the cabins to and American hunting cabin you see on tv is it this a five star hotel definitely not but it‚Äôs rustic and quirky as hell and yeah there are cobwebs etc but hey your in the middle of open country so there are bugs etc but we grew up camping so was not an issue for us but don‚Äôt expect the ritz lol. The sauna was great too wood burning and does get hot!. The outdoor bath is great to take in the scenery especially when it‚Äôs pitch black on the nights. The bedding was freshly laundered and very clean and Stuart is a helpful and very pleasant host his house is nearby and as we had zero phone reception is reassuring in case of any emergency! Candles are provided and great atmosphere enhancers for the nights all the cabins have electricity and dvd and video table players and tv‚Äôs with massive collection of film to watch from kids films through to horrors so all good there! There is a caravan style twin burner and microwave for cooking with cutlery pots and pans etc  Lake vrynwy is a mile away and definitely worth visiting it‚Äôs beautiful and at the artisans cafe there is WiFi so can check in on home if you want too, latte is lovely too. In summing up if you if you can appreciate a more rustic break in beautiful surrounding and just want to relax from the busy world you will love it if you you need a little more luxury then it‚Äôs probably not for you but we loved it!",5
4926,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Hannah,"I had a brilliant time at Stuarts! Its such a cool place, ive never seen anything like it! He's totally done his own thing and its so much fun to see. I lucked out having the whole place to myself on a beautifully hot day so the best experience ever! Enjoyed the nature bath which feels like total luxury and the stars at night were epic! 100% staying again, for longer! Thank you Stuart! Brilliant place you've made üëè",5
4927,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Gail,"Did a last minute booking and it was great value for money given we had the entire space to ourselves. We visit the Lake every season and stay somewhere different and local every time, Stuart's is very local indeed accessed down a tarmac road then down a track, not overly steep and more than doable in a car. Instructions to it are very clear and easy to find.

We stayed in the double room net to the 'Thunder Box' and near the outdoor seating, this room had a little balcony and a kitchen next door which was adequate for us as we generally eat out anyway. Had a indoor/outdoor shower which has the facing wall removed so you have uninterrupted views of the trees below and you can hear the River as you bathe, loved the fact its river water heated up and don't be put off bu the colour, felt very refreshed and clean when got out. 

We were going to use the sauna but never got round to it. Stuart kindly lit the fire for us with his slow torch saving me building and getting the fire going as was lit and well underway within minutes, we took kindling and wood as we were not sure if there would be wood available. Stuart has lots of tea lights for use too. 

As we are of a certain age, it was fun listening to the hiss ion a VHS video again and seeing classic films from our youth, nice retro feel. Sockets by the bed have a USB charger outlet included so can charge phones albeit you have to get above higher ground to get a signal but that is notoriously difficult in the area generally, you can pop to Artisan's cafe and use their free wi-fi. Make sure you take your essentials with you tea/coffee/milk and the local shop shuts early so its not a quick trip for milk. Maybe Stuart could include a point in the fridge to get a brew incase you forget.

If you expect a hotel style sanitised environment then this is not for you, no matter how clean in such a natural surroundings you are going to get spider webs etc, to expect not too is unrealistic. The room was clean, smelt fresh, bedding was clean, bed was fine, kitchen was clean and easy to use, had to wash out the bath and would expect to given one is outside in the elements and the other has 3 walls, but this is not an issue as I said its located in natural surroundings. This is a great place for children too as space for games and critter spotting. The black skies are amazing and as we had aa clear night fab views of stars. It felt remote although it really isn't the village is a mile away, it felt ""off the grid"" and this added to ensuring a relaxed ""leave it all behind you"" stay. We loved our brief stay and especially Hamish the 3 legged girl cat who is adorable and friendly and a huntress as she sat guarding our room and keeping an eye out for critters. You have nothing to lose by trying something different and a lot to gain by going with the flow and chilling out.",5
4928,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Andy,"As mentioned in other reviews, this is a step up from camping so if you enjoy the outdoors, this is the place for you.  

The location is beautiful and very peaceful with access to a secluded stretch of river.  The outdoor shower and baths have loads of hot water and it really is an experience to have a shower outdoors.

For ¬£10 extra, Stuart provided wood for our fire and also for the sauna, both of which, he will light for you if needed.

We enjoyed having no phone signal or WiFi for the weekend and our teenage girls really enjoyed the novelty of watching films on VHS.

There is a small shop in the local village which does takeaway food including pizza and also stocks a selection of meat if you fancy a bbq. 

Stuart was a great host, friendly and there when we needed him but happy to leave us  to our own devices. 

We had a brilliant time and would definitely return.",5
4929,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rebecca,"Stuart‚Äôs place is great if you‚Äôre looking for something different and have young children. We‚Äôve got four children aged between four and eight and they had a great time (we realised how it was happening and have made sure there are no more on the way). It would be easy to miss the place if you didn‚Äôt have good directions as it is down a narrow and bumpy track, but it‚Äôs easy to navigate if you drive slowly. Stuart was a great host and his house is at the other side of the drive from the cabins ‚Äì close enough to offer help if you need anything, but far enough away to give you privacy. He offers a load of wood for a fiver for the fire and is happy to light it for you. He also gave the kids balloons so they could have a water fight. The cabins are all very quirky and different to anywhere else we‚Äôve ever stayed. The outdoor bath is one of the best bits of the place and the kids enjoyed being able to splash about in there and there is also a bath downstairs overlooking the river which is very relaxing in an evening once the kids have gone to bed. The river (which sounds great in an evening) is best accessed walking past Stuart‚Äôs house, as it‚Äôs a bit of a slippery/steep slope directly from the cabins. The kids enjoyed putting on old VHS films and watching them in an evening ‚Äì something they‚Äôve not experienced before (The VHS, not watching films). We were prepared for loads of spiders and insects with it being cabins, but were surprised that there weren‚Äôt many at all. After removing one spider from the kitchen on arrival, that was taller than I was, I was concerned the kids would be panicking, but there was really no need to worry. That spider left amicably and I only saw the odd one after that. There was plenty of space for two adults and four kids and it was nice to have such a decent outdoor space for them to play in. There is also a little kart and a bike for the kids to play on which they enjoyed. All in all, we had a great three night stay at Stuart‚Äôs place and would definitely visit again. It‚Äôs great for young children.",5

After 5 nights in this beautiful, peaceful location we feel fully rested. We were a group of 2 adults, 2 children. The outdoor baths and saunas were a massive bonus. The cabins are cosy and comfortable. The kitchen is basic, but totally adequate. You can hear the river from your bed, and dine around a fire, under the stars. Stuart was helpful and friendly. Great walks locally, including the gorgeous Pistyll Rhaeadr Waterfall, and Lake Vyrnwy. If you are used to camping, this is an upgrade! If you like being close to nature, in unspoilt beauty with fires, saunas and hot outdoor baths then this is the place for you.",5
4933,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Heather,"Excellent stay if you're looking for something different. Made such a nice change to caravan holidays in butlins! 

So much to see in the area. Lake Vrywny was brilliant!  You can hire kayaks for ¬£15. 

Welshpool is also close by. Or just drive around the country roads finding places to stop by the river. There was so much to see.

Our dog enjoyed playing in the river outside the cabins and any other rivers we found along the way.

Stuart was kind enough to light a fire for us on arrival and was very pleasant! He also provided us with a dustbin full of fire wood for ¬£5.

The Kitchen has everything you need microwave, gas hob, kettle and pot/Pans etc and there is also a small BBQ. (Bring some charcoal)

Bedrooms were clean, cosy and warm. 
Loads of VHS tapes to watch!

It really was so much fun.

If you don't like spiders/cobwebs and being outdoors then this isn't for you! 

The Airbnb review printed out and put on the back of the door in the thunder box made us all laugh ü§£.

Stuart was a helpful host but not over intrusive and lit fires for us. We usually go camping so it was lovely to have all the amenities we needed without having to take them with us saying that we did take our large camping chairs which provided us with extra comfort as we sat around the fire at night with our dogs.

It‚Äôs like camping, but with the best bathroom on the planet, outdoor bath and shower with boiling hot water, a kitchen and beds. Linen all clean, bin loads of dry firewood for a fiver, and not a soul in site.  Just trees and the river down below. Rooms are RUSTIC but cosy. It‚Äôs a fantastic getaway.

The tree huts are awesome, you feel like you step in time back to the 90s with the box tvs and cassettes, great childhood throwback. There's no sygnal at all so a good chance to have an internet detox and enjoy the beautiful nature. The night sky was absolutely incredible and the open walled bath is a unique treat. Stuart was really kind and helpful and helped us get the fire going and drew us a map.

BUT, it was one of the most peaceful spaces I've stayed in. The quirky outdoor indoor bathroom was lovely at sundown. the water was hot and plentiful the kitchen was small but practical. The bed dated but comfortable. Nothing is new, cobwebs almost out number the VHS tape collection and it feels a little jumbled together.

Stewart was great, welcoming  and friendly. He‚Äôs a very talented man and interesting to talk to. He left us alone to enjoy the accommodation but was there on hand if we needed anything.

My advice would be if you‚Äôre uptight, a clean freak or don‚Äôt like creepy crawlies then don‚Äôt waste yours, or Stewart‚Äôs, time by staying here. However, if you want a relaxing, quirky and alternative break and have an open mind, book it now!!

Stuart was a very kind and welcoming host; he helped us start the fire, lent us bikes to cycle round Lake Vrwyny and checked in on us to make sure we were OK.
It really is an 'off-grid' stay - we couldn't get any mobile phone signal or internet coverage at all. For this reason, it is a good idea to do your research before you go about what you want to do. But because we weren't distracted by our phones, we had some really good conversations. 
We had a great time cooking on the fire. We also enjoyed watching some of the extensive collection of VHS tapes- brought back memories! Also, be aware that the nearest shop closes at 6:00 -6:30 pm. 
The kitchen is basic but equipped with a stove, stove-top kettle, microwave, fridge and basic utensils. If you do intend to use the fire to cook, it is a good idea to bring some kindling, matches and a skewers. The water was nice and hot, great for the outdoor shower.

4963,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Ella,"This was our second time staying at Stuart‚Äôs cabin and we loved it even more than the first time! Getting away from the City and having no contact with the outside world and no temptation to scroll through social media was exactly what we both wanted. 

We made use of the outdoor bath on each of our 3 night stay and ended up with slightly sore necks from constantly staring up at the amazing starry sky! 

We explored all around the beautiful Lake Vyrnwy on day 1 which is a short distance away. On day 2 we drove to Snowdon and climbed up and down back in time for the sunset, some time in the sauna, sizzling steaks on the fire, a bath under the clear sky and a VHS movie before bed. 

This place is perfect if you want to go back to basics, cook on a wood fire, be amongst nature and escape from the rat race of life. Stuart is incredibly welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. 

Highly recommend for a stay like no other and may return for our third visit at some point!",5
4964,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Romany,"A really amazing place to visit. The location itself is near a beautiful lake, and we drove about 1-2hours to get to a walk we had planned for Snowdon. Slight issue not having any WiFi/phone signal for maps, but Stuart was really helpful in giving directions. The space is an incredible bit of work and the pics show it well, the bath being a real highlight in the evening. I‚Äôve given the rating of cleanliness as 3, largely because it is outside and naturally there are cobwebs etc - but of course this did not affect the experience.",5

The location is amazing, in a beautiful valley overlooking a steam. It's amazingly peaceful! The cabins are great, super quirky and we took full advantage of the outside bath spending the evening looking up at the stars and listening to the water from the stream. No WiFi or phone signal means you really get the chance to switch off and enjoy being surrounded by nature! We will definitely be back!",5
4969,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Julie,"The scenery and the setting are absolutely stunning. The best memory is having a nighttime open air bath, looking out over the trees and the river.
The accommodation and facilities are basic and quirky and feel more like a camping experience. So, if you're looking for a boutique hotel this isn't for you. But if you want to enjoy all that nature has to offer then you'll love this place.
There are 2 outside baths and an outdoor shower. The water in the taps come from a well. There's a log store for a washingmachine drum BBQ. No WiFi. No telephone signal. A real step out of the rat race.",4
4970,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Cara,"Location is great, it felt like camping indoors. Was definately cold at night as everything is so open. Would benefit from a mobile fan heater to take to different rooms depending on where you want to socialise and a big rug in treehouse to block out cold. A summer retreat will be booked as Stuart was a wonderful and welcoming host. As there is no wifi or phone signal its worth thinking of taking a bluetooth speaker or cd music which doesnt involve wifi. Only personal to me as i like music. This place is very remote and very quiet, a perfect quiet retreat thank you",5

We‚Äôll be visiting again very soon.",5

If you love the outdoors and camping this place is magical. The sauna was perfect and the outdoor shower is great with a big square shower head to keep you warm even if its raining. Having a hot bath outside was the icing on the cake, we had a clear night, the rain stopped and we saw hundreds of stars. It was amazing. The place is so quiet you cant hear any cars so we sat outside on the porch for breakfast and dinner listening to the river. It's an outdoor experience so everywhere is open to the elements to some degree but the bedroom was always warm and cosy. Hopefully we will be back again. Definitely reccomend this place.",4

4983,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,George,"Outstanding! My partner and I stayed here for one night but regretted not booking a longer stay. We had the whole place to ourselves, and for the price we paid, it felt like an absolute steal. Despite being a genuine, back-to-nature experience, the entire complex was still very modern and clean. Why would you want to book a boring hotel room when you could stay somewhere like this? Couldn't recommend it enough! :D",5

Exactly as we wanted a break from our everyday lives! The sound of the river was fantastic whilst reading and enjoying a cuppa! 
Stuart was fab, great host, checking we were okay on several occasions during the stay. Heating was on for when we arrived so our rooms were snug! 
We used both indoor and outdoor baths, very relaxing! 
I think the listing is very honest and what you see is what you get! 
We will certainly be back again!",5

I never thought I‚Äôd enjoy having a bath outside so much. We were comfortable and toasty warm and truly relaxed and enjoyed our surroundings. Everything is in keeping with nature and the outdoors but the homely touches are something else. It‚Äôs so quirky and you get back to exploring and having fun. Having all the candles lit was truly magical and listening to the river. Just wonderful and we‚Äôll definitely be back.,5

Very rustic and brilliantly located within a river bottomed forest valley. The view is remarkable and surrounded by nature. True to say nature has slightly invaded the cabins just a little but it is to be expected! If you want pristine white marble go to London and book in at the Dorchester!! Sat around the fire pit made from a washing machine inner was great. Having no signal was great. (Try it) Bedrooms having VHS videos was great for last thing at night when the fire was dying. Perfect for exploring the area and the view from the outdoor living area is awesome watching the sunset!! Stuart the host is a lovely friendly interesting chap and was on hand if needed even to light the fire although being hardened outdoors types we managed okay!! Games and puzzles are available too. Don‚Äôt wear your Sunday best and you‚Äôll have a great time!! Brilliant!!,5

We loved the space, privacy, fresh air, out of the way location and great supply of old films on video. Our son discovered a love of the Simpsons. It's very well placed to visit Snowdonia and Lake Vyrnwy. There's a shop down the road that stocks mostly everything you need and excellent Welsh cakes.
Stuart was there to greet us and was helpful. Lit a fire the first night and suggested activities.  Before you stay make sure you read the reviews and look at the photos and then you'll know what to expect. Quirky and characterful accommodation that helps you get away from it all.",4

5013,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Louis,"Stuart it was a pleasure staying at your property, we had arrived without notice due to signal issues and Stuart welcomed us warmly.
We are 4, 25 year olds and are quite picky when it comes to things. We love places which look and feel amazing, this place really is better in person than on the listing. 
I took my drone with my and shot amazing visuals around the area and the local big lake and Dam which only took 5 minute drive. 
The location is excellent and as this is an eco stay please be reminded signal on phones is very very limited! To the point you really have to go oldschool with the old maps and not on your phone.
But you drive 20 minutes away and you will receive signal.
(I mention this because for young people it's very important)
But please take what I say for signal not a bad point.
We all enjoyed not receiving anything from the outside world and only enjoying each others company.
My girlfriend really enjoyed the outdoor bath with candles lit and the fairy LED lights above gave an excellent effect. 
The space is fantastic you really could go here with 8 people and it wouldn't be an issue. 
Stuart provides you with more than what you need for a nights stay. We had extra plug in heaters for when it got cold, and more than enough extra bedding.
Stuart himself really helped us with our whole trip, as we only came because we wanted to hike in Snowdonia. Stuart provided us with directions to an amazingly scenic route along our journey to the mountains. This drive was breathtaking and we even saw wild horses roaming freely. 
Please also be aware of one other thing which really didn't cross my mind until I arrived back home, and that's the TICKS. I assume I got them from a waterfall which is by the big lake, but in damp conditions I think that's why. 
This isn't a negative thing as TICKS are found in various places in the UK in any damp conditions! 
I really would come back and visit Stuarts property again have I ever go to that side of the country.
All 4 of us give a rating of 5 out of 5. 
Thanks Stuart!

You could probably get two families there if you know them, would be nice gathering. Or a group of friends. 
You won't get signal so take a few games if the weather is bad. Stew was very accommodating with lighting a fire and offering a drink, if you need the help. Otherwise he respects your privacy.

Top tip follow Stew's written directions at the end when you turn of on the hairpin bend. Or you'll do what we did and have to reverse up an all terrain track.",5

Loved the country walks and great outdoor bath. Great for both a couple escape and family adventure.... We taking kids next time. Its a proper escape, so expect spiders and things, loved this better than any hotel. 

As for host.... He's a great guy. Greeted us on arrival and showed us around, started the campfire and got us plenty of wood, aloud us complete freedom around the entire area, even invited us in for a natter and drink. Really friendly and couldn't do enough.",5

A series of wooden cabins and tree house, it is certainly not a conventional holiday let. But we loved it and will definitely come back again. Be aware this is a little like a mixture of normal b&b and camping.

Stuart is a very friendly and helpful host and communication was very easy.

A highlight for us was the bath with an unhindered view of the river (ie no wall or window....it just looks out over the river.) You may think this might be a bit drafty, but we loved it after our swim in the river on a wet day in March. The shower also does not have a roof, and there is a second bath that is completely outdoors. Fantastic!! Lots of hot water too. Shame we didnt find time for the sauna.

The main bedroom cabins were warm and cosy and we had a comfortable nights sleep listening to the rain and the river.

If you like camping üèï without the hassle of pitching your tent and with all amenities at hand then this is your place!  

A few reviews mention the cleanliness as being an issue and this would be true if you were paying hotel prices!  (Camping clean) that‚Äôs what I would say! But mainly only the kitchen which has seen a lot of use. 

The hideout bath was absolutely amazing! Hot water in abundance and the campfire under the stars was lovely!  

Massive selection of VHS to chose from and every time you look a little closer you find a new random souvenir of some kind hanging around!  

I was skeptical on arrival but had the best time! Big bowl of chilli on the second night with some baked potatoes finished off in the fire pit! 

Lovely bubble bath with lots of candles and a glass of red whilst looking over the river! 

Definitely one to remember and will be back in the summer!

Did nearly get snowed in on the last day due to waking up to a layer of snow, no WiFi or phone signal so was worried a little but managed to get out after a few attempts!

Didn‚Äôt see much of Stuart but he did show us around and popped over on first night to light the sauna!

Following Stuarts direction to the property made finding the accomodation a breeze. We were warmly welcomed with a glass of Pinot, pleasant conversation, followed by a tour of the grounds. We unfortunately arrived during storm Dennis, so as expected the pathways were very muddy and slippery, but this did not spoil our experience, the cabins have stunning views of the river that runs through Stuarts land, it has to be seen to be believed. 
We stayed in the main cabin, it is far from a shed but a properly built log cabin that kept us dry and warm! The whole place is very cute and cosy.
 The kitchen was well supplied with plates and cooking accessories and the bedroom has a small TV with a big choice of VHS to choose from
 Bathing outside in the storm is an experience I will never forget, and bathing in the skypod in the morning with the river running directly in front of you is simply amazing. Stuarts house is closer than it appears in photos, however it is downhill of the cabins offering privacy. 
 When we checked out we were kindly offered a cup of tea which we turned down as we had a long drive ahead, however Stuart made a point of insisting we visit the Lake and Dam, and we are thrilled he did so, as this was simply stunning.
 We can't wait to experience Stuarts property again in the warmer and dryer weather!.",5

We came to celebrate my daughter's 15th birthday and being outdoors types we love to get away from it all and experience something different.  The cabins were perfect for our needs and despite the temperature plummeting to freezing on a January night, they were warm and cosy.   Comfortable beds and plenty of bedding, blankets and towels.  So many great touches everywhere from the hundreds of tealights to the vast array of videos.  
Our favourite part was the baths.  One outdoors and one in the skypod, both open to the elements, we tried each one.  Piping hot water and plenty for both and I have to say that lying in a open air bath on a dark, cold January night looking at the stars is an experience that will stay with me!  Just wonderful.
Stuart was very welcoming, showing us all the facilities and he came back later to check we were ok, offering to light the campfire for us.  
All in all a fantastic stay and if you're after something a little different then this place is highly recommended!",5

Just around the corner from lake Vyrnwy dam, where you can go brid watching, cycling, sailing or just enjoy the fresh welsh air and scenery. 
Great amenities: everything we needed from microwave, cooking stove, hotwater, fridge, toaster, electric and heating.

I feel we bonded so much as a family. He kids loved the outside bath, I loved the bath in the hut & the little great tit that flew in each morning whilst I looked out down to the river.  The VHS collection was such a hit with us & the kids. So much to do on the doorstep.... the lake was stunning & the waterfall a beautiful find at the end of a superb scenic walk. Really can‚Äôt recommend this place enough!  If it was like this in winter then god knows how amazing it‚Äôd be in the summer! Just go... let yourself unwind, let your kids be kids & just bind with each other.  No signal for phones but god... I bloody loved that fact!!!! Total tranquility. Thank you so much Stuart!

The outside baths are fantastic I could have stayed in these all weekend. The main bedroom hut was warm upon arrival, the sauna is a must after a long day exploring the lake nearby, it was what we needed to wind down. Overal you have everything you need and then a few experiences that you won't get with other properties like the outdoor baths and the old-style TVs with loads of videos, a nice touch on an already impressive place. Stuart is a wonderful host, suggesting local things to do and always being on hand if we needed anything. We are planning to come back already! We also fell in love with Stuart's very friendly cat Hamish who will pop over and visit you from time to time.",5

Stuart was a wonderful host who greeted us warmly and lit the fire for us. 
If you're expecting a hotel experience you will be dissatisfied, this is a Glamping experience. It's very close to nature.

 The toilet and kicthen are separate to the cabins so you have to go outside to access them. The shower is outdoors and doesn't offer much privacy from other guests in your party. 

The cabins we stayed in were lovely and warm with the heaters on however there is no heating in the kitchen or toilet. 
There was lots of hot water for the baths though and they are such a novelty! Bathing outside in the rain was amazing!
Stuart has the most impressive VHS collection and what a time warp that was, rewinding video tapes! 
This place is very unique and the surrounding area just beautiful. 
Highly recommend (but only if you're a bit outdoorsy)",5
5054,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Christina,This was an amazing place to stay. Very much looking forward to revisiting in the summer months with hopefully a little less rain!,5
5055,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Josh,"If you're coming for a relaxing / de-stress / weekend break or as a treat, then this place is ideal - a great find and worth the money!! The beautiful and peaceful surroundings, the sauna, the outdoor hot tub (note: it's a bath tub, but the water's hot enough to be close to a hot tub) combined with star-gazing on a clear night were brilliant!!
Note: I say it was worth the money as I was able to make use of the sauna and hot tub - i.e. make the most of what this stay has to offer. If you're coming just for an overnight stay, and not able to use the amenities mentioned, you may not find it as good value for money.

I stayed in the hut furthest. And it was a nice little room sufficiently furnished. Had a small TV with a VCR player and loads of VCR films - be prepared for nostalgia! And there's a kitchen next door, which was pretty well-equipped with a gas hob, some cooking pots and pans, a fridge, cutlery, crockery, a microwave, toaster, drinking water can, and even some basic things like oil.

Note that this is in part, an outdoor experience (bit like glamping). If you come expecting a hotel-like stay, you'll be unpleasantly surprised. But if you come expecting an outdoor experience, you'll be pleasantly surprised, as it was pretty good/better than I expected for an outdoor experience.

Stuart was a great host, welcoming me soon as I arrived, close by and available when help was needed, kindly turning on the heating in the hut I was going to stay before I arrived. And topping it all off, in the morning when I got stuck in the snow trying to get out, he was willing to help tow me up the hill!!


So all in all, I would recommend, and would personally consider going again!

Note on location: Be careful to follow Stuart's instructions regarding directions, rather than following Google maps or AirBnB's map.",5

Stuart was very welcoming when we arrived. If you do want to use the sauna you should tell him in good time so he is able to set it up,",4
5059,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Suraya,"Stuart place was a very quirky, fun  and give a ""camping experience"".
We had a good time with all the cassettes since the weather was with heavy rain. Stuart welcome us and showed the place around, was very friendly and funny. We asked for have the Sauna and he light up for us, unfortunately we couldn't use the bath outside because of the heavy rain. (Was too cold as well) The views are beautifull and the river sound is very peaceful.
We stayed in the cabins by the kitchen since this were the ones with the heating on.
The sky pod and the tree house were amazing but more a summer place. We visited the lake close by and was beautifull.
The sauna cabin had a bit of dump smell but I guess the Sauna brings a lot of humidity to the place.
We loved the skeleton in the entrance of the property, the zombie hand and all the quirky details but was a bit of a shame that the cleanliness wasn't so well. 
I love camping and hallowen is my favourite season but I beleive that the place with a bit more love and care would be even better. (At least toilet, shower and kitchen) Was very small drops of rain in my cabin, the toilet was full of drops every where, like a ""shower toilet"", the shower was with open roof what was a shame because with rain we didn't had a hot shower. The kitchen was greasy and full of spider webs with dead bugs on it. I do love the quirky and camping experience but like I said a bit of love and care and the place would have been perfect. I advise to separate the cabins on the booking site, guests will get only what they choose and is easier to prepare for guests to stay, avoids desapointment too. ( had similar experiences before and we even had a little welcome gift with local things) Overall we liked the experience, will come back but in a summer time.",3

If you fancy something which is a step up from camping, which is great value for money, then you will like this.  There is no light pollution so it is a great place to do star gazing and where else in the world can you lie in a warm bath outside and do star gazing! Stuart supplied us with logs for the camp fire and there is an outside picnic table so it was a great place for the four of us to socialise and enjoy the evening together. It is very close to Lake Vyrnwy which is a very beautiful area. Loved every minute of our trip so will definitely recommend Stuart's place to friends.",5
5066,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rosie,"Fantastic place, great host, stunning location! Dont really know where to start but we loved staying here. We are into our outdoor spaces and 'rusticness' so we had to try this place out. It was more lovely than the pictures showed and was definitely one of the most relaxing placed we've stayed in. If you are into camping whilst still having some of the home comforts then I'd definitely recommend it. The outdoor bath tub (and a second bath tub in an opened-sided bathroom) were the highlights for me - a bath under the stars listening to the sounds of the river was a new experience. Stuart is a great host who made us very welcome, he invited us in for drinks and let us use his internet (as there's no 4g in the area) and gave us tips about where to go. He even gave some toy ducks to our duck-obsessed 2 year old. We also made great use of Stuart's extensive old VHS collection in the cabins to pass the evenings, and our girl loved her introduction to some classic kids films. It's also in a great location with gorgeous countryside and a local shop a short drive away. We will definitely be back for another visit!",5

Thanks Stuart!!",5
5068,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Hannah,"We had an amazing stay here and enjoyed exploring the area, as well as climbing Crib Goch and Mount Snowdon (about 1 1/2 hours away).

We really enjoyed the quirky set-up; much more interesting than staying in a hotel, but more comfy than camping! There were old TVs and VHS tape players so we watched several videos from their selection which was a great rainy afternoon activity!

The outdoor bath and shower were super fun, and made a change from the usual boring routine you get stuck in! No signal/ internet which we liked as it was nice to just switch off and enjoy the beautiful countryside.

Stuart was a great host and provided extras like firewood for our BBQ which was very kind of him. We also had a drink with him one evening and it was great to swap stories. 

I would definitely recommend the stay, it's very quirky and unusual and not something you usually experience! The amenities are basic but there are heaters and plenty of hot water so it was comfortable all the same. Thank you Stuart!",5

5070,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Mike,"Entrance is via a ‚Äòsteep gravel track‚Äô, and you‚Äôll know you‚Äôre there when you see ‚Äòradiation risk‚Äô and ‚Äòbeware of the bull‚Äô signage with a severed hand and skeleton.  Despite passing a comment about these bizarities, the host greeted with a straight face before showing us the ‚Äòaccommodation‚Äô.

We had a choice of horrors. At best, the cabins are poorly made garden sheds, at worst they‚Äôre wooden hellscapes. The first thing shown was the outdoor bathtub (in full view of the hosts property) with a frightened rubber duck chained to it. An alternative ‚Äòshower‚Äô was no more than a floor of dirty concrete paving stones with green mould growing up the side.

The first cabin, ‚ÄòBisiker Towers‚Äô held a selection of VHS tapes, a dirty CRT tele, bunk beds, thick cobwebs and an overpowering musty odour. The bed linens were ancient and smelt it. I hazard a guess that they were last washed during the coal mining strikes.

We made our way past the ‚ÄúThunderbox‚Äù which was little more than a spider-infested portaloo.

The next cabin was the Juhannus, with a double bed, an even bigger selection of VHS tapes, some art work (a block of blue canvas, presumably covering something worse), its own selection of spiders, thick dust and a ‚Äòmemory box‚Äô drawer filled with various litter of previous victims.

Next, the kitchen shed. Everything was filthy. The host said to not drink the water, only to have it from a half-filled dirty plastic container.

Across a rickety bridge to the ‚ÄôSky Pod‚Äô,  you‚Äôll see a very used sofa bed, more musty sheets, and a trap door leading to a toilet.  On inspecting the toilet, you‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs open to the forest via a missing wall.  Romantic? It‚Äôs not as private as you think - you‚Äôre essentially in the hosts garden.

The third and final cabin was viewed.  There‚Äôs four in total but we didn‚Äôt get access to the other which legend says holds a sauna.  The ‚ÄòTreehouse‚Äô is another precarious-looking structure.  Inside from left to right is a wash basin from a caravan which dispensed brown water, a large clock on the ceiling, more spiders and dust, a sofa which clearly had a hard life and (like my now fleeting sense of self-preservation) deflated cushions, a selection of cobweb-covered cups, 3 ‚Äòquirky‚Äô Sports Direct bottles covered in literal dirt, a camping bed, a glass cabinet on top of which lived a dead sheep‚Äôs skull (killed by the lack of adequate hygiene) with a taxidermy bird inside. Two more musky beds, one with a spiders egg on it. The host asked if we were okay, we said yeah not wanting to know what was in the fourth cabin as we had no phone signal or WiFi to signal an emergency.

After a 5 minute discussion on the pros and cons of sleeping in the car, we went towards the nearest town to find phone signal and look up the nearest Travelodge. It felt safe and somewhat clean.",1

5094,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Claire,"Tranquillity, romance, a space to think.. this place has it all. I cannot stop raving about Stuart's little haven. Sitting in a hot tub, protected from the wind, and an unobstructed view to the river and forest below.. for that price you'd be a fool not to visit. Stuart is the loveliest host, and we have now been back 2 years on the trot now. Cannot believe how lucky we are to have found this absolute gem. The lake near by, the chicken burgers from the shop close by, the locals, everything and everyone is to die for. We'll see you next year Stuart!!!",5

But this place is quirky and rustic so if that‚Äôs your thing then it‚Äôs fab! Lots of random decorations,but the basics such as kitchen/toilet and beds all well kept! The three main cabins heat up well for a snug night sleep.Stuart interacted with us and set up the sauna before leaving us to enjoy the night,the outdoors baths are a must!",5

Only able to stay for 1 night but had a lovely time & had the whole place to ourselves. Found easily following Stuarts directions, private place where all you can hear are the river, birds and crackling of the fire! We stayed in the large cabin which was comfortable and warm, with the heating being put on before we arrived. A great base for exploring the local area, definitely go see the local waterfall. Would stay again.",5

5100,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Becky,"Very quirky and interesting stay at Stuart's place. The location is lovely with just a short drive away from Lake Vrnwy. Stuart was very helpful in telling us where to visit in the local area. When we arrived there he showed us the 3 cabins. One was heated up for our arrival which was a nice touch. Unfortunately his treehouse was still having work done to it when we arrived, which was a shame as we wanted to stay in there. We loved his little 3-legged cat who came to say hello, very friendly! The sauna was brilliant and well built, we enjoyed getting toasty on a chilly evening. Stuart has a huge selection of videos to watch on a classic old TV which we thoroughly enjoyed.

There are a few things to bare when booking:

The cabins are very dusty, 2 of which had thick cobwebs everywhere and spiders eggs along the ceiling which did put me off. The furthest cabin is the most maintained one so all 4 of us decided to stay in this one which was fine for us.

The facilities state 'Hot tub' but this is in fact an outdoor bath tub so bare this in mind.

The kitchen utensils, gas hob and pans are very dirty and oily, though this is a reflection on the previous guests, not Stuart as it is the guests responsibility to clean up after themselves which unfortunately people have not done.

Overall Stuart has put in a lot of effort into building these cabins/sauna and we must commend him on this. He is a very friendly and helpful person who we enjoyed getting to know and would be happy to stay here again in the warmer summer months.",4

Communication was excellent on the lead up to our stay, Stuart gave good instruction for getting to his place, met us on arrival showed us around (and had the heating on ready in the hut we were sleeping in as the weather had been chilly, which was a lovely touch)..

5112,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kate,"Beautiful setting and quirky cabins, but hygiene was not up to standard. The bed had been changed but the surfaces in the cabin and kitchen and the fridge had not been cleaned - had old bits of food in fridge and kitchen surfaces, dust and grime on cabin surfaces, crumbs on chair in cabin etc.
We couldn't bring ourselves to stay one night because we had our baby, which we had been allowed to book with an infant, but we did not feel the hygiene and the draughty main cabin door was safe for a baby to sleep in or prepare food for in the kitchen.
If I had been paying camping prices I would not have minded, but this was alot more expensive and in my opinion, not worth it for the state it is currently in, as it has been left unloved and unclean.",2

Stuart is really helpful whilst also respecting your privacy and he has added some really lovely touches to the place such as a collection of VHS tapes, spare hats and candles to name a few. The outdoor baths were amazing we were able to enjoy a clear night sky whilst being in the bath by candlelight. And I would recommend using the bath in the sky pod in the morning to look out over the river it is a wonderful experience. We were quite cold the first night but the second night we used the extra blankets Stuart provided and then we were fine so if you are going make sure you use the blankets the place is quite back to nature but that is what makes it so charming. The treehouse wasn‚Äôt available for us to use which was disappointing as we were looking forward to using it but we didn‚Äôt really mind as we loved the cabin we ended up staying in and we are excited about what developments Stuart has got planned for the treehouse!
We have done and would definitely recommend to a friend.",5

5124,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rebecca,"This place is amazing. make no mistake it is an outdoor space and thus there will be cobwebs and such however if you're not adverse to this and like a rustic stay then this is the prefect place for you. Some things to note are that the way you leave it is how other people find it, such like if you do not clean a pan it is the guests responsibly to clean up the kitchen items they use not the host. Also there are 2 baths, one is outside and completely exposed, the other is downstairs in the wood cabin on stilts and has a bit more privacy but still outside (the water as people have said is boiling hot). We stayed on a lovely mid week in Feb, cold on a morning and hot in an afternoon. The only issue was that it was so cold on a morning the shower door was frozen shut and the pipes to the bath frozen so we couldn't wash on a morning, also the outside toilet was frozen over but cant be helped. Stuart is an incredible host with plenty of hospitably, we were even luck enough o be invited into his home for a drink, he has created a truly remarkable place. The sauna is good but not red hot and also very wood intensive so have a bath instead as its much nicer in my opinion. kitchen is well equipped with everything for your needs and sitting outside with the fire on and grilling burgers is the memory ill hold the most. We took a gorgeous walk to lake Vyrnwy with a map drawn by Stuart, couldn't ask for a better stay.",4

We arrived about half an hour before the snow did, and boy, did it snow! All our plans for waterfall hikes and trips round the area were hastily rethought, and instead we explored Lake Vyrnwy - just a five minute drive away - and even then we needed 4x4! But it couldn‚Äôt have been a better place to be marooned, we lit the brazier outside, poured a G&T (no ice needed!!)  and enjoyed the solitude and clear star filled sky. Bliss.

Completely off the beaten track, secluded and still manages to be homely. A real explorers retreat. We arrived late and went straight in the bath, the water is boiling!! Stuart has left candles and matches everywhere giving it that extra touch, we then went to bed and watched a video from Stuart‚Äôs massive collection of classics. Our cabin was so toasty and warm, really cosy and the bed was really comfortable too. We got up and made pancakes (took our own ingredients) and it was so easy thanks to the perfect kitchen. We had a frying pan, spatular and hob, everything was incredibly clean. We then packed up and spent the day in Lake Vyrnwy which was amazing and only a short drive from the cabins.

The cabins are simple, with lots of quirky items. 
Unfortunately the weather was awful and it rained throughout. That didn't stop us using the new open fronted cabin and outdoor sho. 
The rooms have heater and TV to watch the HUGE collection of VHS on, which we loved :)

We were lucky enough to stargaze and see the milky way one night whilst in the outdoor bath.  The location is remote and when following directions be careful not to miss the gravel road as initially it looks like a footpath but in daylight parking can be seen at the bottom of the road. It is possible to walk to Lake Vrynwy. The bedrooms in the main cabins have heating but wrap up warm in autumn/winter months if wanting to enjoy the outdoor space. Also if travelling in a group like we did be careful not to use all the hot water enjoying the luxurious baths leaving not enough to go round.

It‚Äôs very open plan and so it‚Äôs to be expected that there‚Äôs leaves and spiders because of the time of year and because of how open to nature it is, if these things bother you then it‚Äôs not the place for you. However if you enjoy being outdoors and in nature, taking a bath and watching the sun set and sitting by a fire then I would recommend. All the linen and bedding was very fresh the overall vibe of the place was very warm and welcoming.

Stuart is very helpful and friendly, he came each night to help light the fire, he was able to answer and questions we had and even offered to let us in his own home for a drink. We will defiantly book again.",5

5165,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kerry,"Rustic site, set in a beautiful area.  Slightly tricky to locate the small road leading to the complex so I would ask in advance.  You are at one with nature and basic living, however Stuart the host is exceptional and I can honestly say we had a fantastic time.",4
5166,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sam,"Wow! If you love nature and can cope without 3,4 or 5* luxury then this place is great to get away from it all ( no WIFI) and relax in front of the log burner looking up at the incredible stars and at 3am the Milky Way was also awesome to see!
So, Stuart is a lovely host,  he has cleverly built everything, and very eclectically furnished everything. There is no ‚Äúwomans touch‚Äù so do not expect a hotel room here, it‚Äôs fully functional, quirky, enjoyable but be warned, no toilet in the bedroom ‚Äú shed‚Äù so if you need to get up in the night frequently you might want to take a bedpan with you! 

Not suitable for toddlers ( a health and safety nitemare!) but older kids would love staying in a treehouse! 

Having a hot steaming bath exposed to nature watching the bats flying by and the breeze through my hair was an experience I will never forget.

We loved it!",5

I stayed here with 3 of my children (aged 8, 11 & 16) and we all had a brilliant time. Stuart really is a super host, going above and beyond to be welcoming and helpful. He took us out in the forest in his truck and showed us around the local area, invited us over for drinks, lit the wood burner each night, gave the kids water bombs and glow sticks ....... That said, he did not invade out privacy and the location is very secluded and peaceful. 
The outdoor bath and sky pod bath are beyond words and were one of the highlights of the holiday. 
Yes there are cobwebs etc but that's exactly what you should expect. 
Think of this as camping/glamping with the most amazing extras.",5

We stayed for 3 nights with our children (ages 6 and 3). The outdoor baths were great. The views amazing. Stuart was a very welcoming and friendly host.

The kitchen was very basic and limited on storage space for food. You need to take everything other than washing up liquid. There is no running drinking water, it is plentifully supplied in a large container. Lots of cutlery and crockery.

There were plenty of toilet rolls, clean bedding and towels. A great supply of night lights. 

We did not use the outdoor shower or sauna. We really enjoyed the outdoor fire and having access to plenty of wood. 

The views, the peace and the wildlife were outstanding. ",4

5182,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kaye,"Myself and my 8 year old son have just returned from Stuart's. We spent only 2 nights and i really wish it had been longer. 
Stuart rang me before we arrived to make sure I knew how to get there and check our check in time. He greeted us on arrival with a glass of wine and some really handy local tips. The cabins run adjacent to the side of Stuart's house but it is not overlooked and I still felt like we had privacy. The views over the dip in the valley and the river below are fantastic. We heard woodpeckers, owls and saw some big birds of prey. Stuart gave my son water ballons and a water pistol and encouraged him to ""go bananas"" so it was great feeling that i could just let him play without having to worry. The cabins were fantastic. The bedding and towels smelled fresh and there were plenty of utensils in the kitchen and soap and loo roll to use. As previous reviews state, they may be cabins however it is very outdoorsy so you will meet spiders, cobwebs and moths etc. We love all that so it was no problem basically living outdoors but with a roof. The cabins are comfy and cosy and well built. 
The bath......well my son spent a lot of time in it, it's fab!!! Water super hot and great to have a soak and relax. 
His land is vast and we had a lovely walk down to the river and did some paddling. There is a local shop in the village that does hot food and great bacon sandwiches. These set us up nicely for the journey home and the guy that runs the shop is lovely too.
On our last night Stuart had a friend round with some local children so that my son could play with them and we had a few drinks around his chimenea. 
Stuart is very welcoming and fantastic with children....my son will never be the same after a trip out on his quadbike! 
We really did have a fantastic time and will most certainly return in the future. ",5

Stuart as a host is very welcoming and friendly, and came over for a few chats with us and helped us with the fire pit. However he gave us a lot of privacy as well and left us to just get on with things on our own, which was also nice. Considering we were a group of teenagers aged 18-20, we never felt unwelcome at all - especially as we aren't exactly the quietest group. Stuart provided plenty of towels and there was more utensils than we thought in the kitchen - plenty of pans aswell as cutlery, glasses, bowls and plates. Overall, we had a lovely time and our only regret was that we didn't stay longer. ",5

Stuart was the perfect host - we felt relaxed and welcome even though we are not the quietest bunch. In response to the reviews about cleanliness; it's not clean because it essentially outdoors - if you want clean then don't go camping, stay in a hotel. Stuart provided plenty of towels, toilet roll, soap, kitchen utensils and crockery. The linen smelt clean as did the towels. There is wifi but it's sketchy. There is no phone signal so don't expect to be able to contact the outside world. We all enjoyed the lack of communication! The only thing I would suggest is that you bring your own bottled water - the taps are not drinking water and nobody likes drinking out of a plastic gerry can. The outdoor shower was lovely and hot as was the bath water (extremely hot actually). In the rain this place may not have been so lovely, but we were blessed with glorious weather and could not have had a nicer weekend. Thoroughly recommend and will definitely be returning. ",5
5201,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Paul,"A very quirky place - in a great way. From very soon after arriving we were already talking about coming back, and that only amplified during our stay. Host is lovely, and the place is both a great place to be and a great base from which to explore a really wonderful part of the world. There‚Äôs lots to do and see, and we really only saw a small fraction of it.

As a place to hang out and stare across the river at the bank of trees and the skyline it‚Äôs great. Kids were never bored and adults have a lovely space to sit and chat after sundown.

It‚Äôs probably not for everyone - lots that‚Äôs rough and ready, and it‚Äôs sort of ‚Äòsuper-glamping‚Äô, but the place is built with a lot of love and care, and the location is a stunner.

We really loved it.",5
5202,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Nicole,"Stuart is a lovely host and made our stay as pleasant as possible. Unfortunately it was pouring with rain and the toilet roof is in need of repairs as it leaks very badly, so I got soaked using the loo. The mats and loo roll were also soaked and the floor muddy. Cobwebs and dust are a given in the outdoors, but the kitchen was just too dirty for me to want to cook in so we went out to eat instead. The shower looked equally unappealing, but the outdoor bath is absolutely blissful. However, my partner was unable to use it in the morning as there were people walking about outside the main house and there is no privacy screening - so make sure to enjoy a bath when it's dark or very early in the morning.",3

Managed to last about an hour is minus temperatures with a few top ups of hot water. Stuart was really welcoming and very helpful!

Nice view from the cabins and really quiet/secluded location. Stuart is really lovely and came over for a chat one evening, gave us some useful tips on what‚Äôs nice to see which was nice.

We did not have internet or signal throughout our duration and it couldn't have been better. The only time we reached for our phones was to snap a picture of the scenic surroundings, stream and lake. If visiting in Winter starting up the camp fire, relaxing in the sauna and running a hot outdoor bath under the stars is a must. There were plenty of candles to enioy and Stuart was kind enough to invite us in for a drink and chat.  We look forward to a return visit.",5

The weather was a bit unfortunate for us but we still had a lovely time. Just chilling in the surrounding and having a trip around the lake as well as food out and a few drinks. The selection of old videos we found a lovely touch and the outdoor bath was perfect. Only thing I would say is the dog hairs in the room.. not a big deal as I understand there's dogs on the property. It's just they were on the bed and with a small baby they were getting in his mouth. But regardless all round it was lovely. Thanks Stuart.,4

We didn't have use of the sauna this time but the outside bath was a treat! The bedroom has a heater on all night so we were very warm and cosy. There is no toaster or grill so bear that in mind for breakfast options. 
If you're driving down the B4396, at the end of the road (tiny petrol station thing on the right), take a left rather than follow signs towards the lake. So you're heading away from the lake.",4

As expected the place does get cold without the heater on and there are cobwebs and spiders in the kitchen and toilet (what do you expect from an outdoor cabin) but all the facilities are really clean and well looked after and the heaters and water gets really really hot. Stuart was a great host and looked after us really well. The hill is steeper than the pictures show so may not be suitable for toddlers but the pictures for everything else does not do this place enough justice.

The log cabin was already warm and cosy when we arrived and our host Stuart was very accommodating and not far away should we need any additional help.  The Sauna was available for use and a great fire pit and outdoor seating for a fresh evening out to watch the stars.  Not far away was the great Lake Vyrnwy with various walks around the area to your preference.  Stuart was friendly and invited us into his home for a glass of wine and a tour around his country Cottage.

5263,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Shaunie,"Unfortunately we arrived a little later than expected due to my partners late finish from his shift as a paramedic. We were greeted with sarcasm and disappointment as Stuart had put a fire up for us but sadly had gone out before we arrived. We only stayed for a small amount of time before leaving again. The only reason we left was purely because of the lack of cleanliness and hygiene. We are from the countryside so we understand a few spider and webs but this was a unkempt infestation, with false widow spiders. Not only this but the kitchen was beyond filthy, tea stains, grease on cutlery, rancid food in bottom of fridge. The floor looked like it had not even been swept or clean as bottle caps were scattered all over the floor. The linen looked old and due the filthy setting  did not feel confident that they had even been cleaned. Stuart's house over looks the entire log cabin area and is very close on site which disappointed us as we believed it was private and ""secluded"" we felt misled by the lack of information and photographs provided. Also beware the narrow lane leading to the accommodation as it is very unsuitable for road vehicles we scraped and scratched the bottom of the car driving up and down it. We were so disappointed as the cabins were in a perfect setting and it was such a shame that they were not and probably not ever kept clean for clients paying to stay in them.",1

It's like paradise in The Welsh countryside! We explored 2 local waterfalls and did some of the treks around the local lake.

It's an amazing experience especially for someone like me who doesn't like camping but wants to enjoy the outdoors. It's very serene, especially at night. You wake up to the birds singing and the sounds of the river flowing, absolutely refreshing. The outdoor bathtub is lovely especially at night surrounded by glowing candlelight. The outdoor shower is very nice as well. The water was always hot. The kitchen is functional, we cooked breakfast and had BBQ in the evenings. We brought our own food in a cooler box as the local shop only has limited food options. Stuart kindly drew a map for us to walk to Lake Vyrnwy and back to the cabins about 6miles. We then drove out again in order to walk to the waterfall as the lake is a 12mile round trip. 

Warning, this is not glamping. You will have spiders webs and insects around you. The place could be cleaner but it's value for money. ",4
5279,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Gemma,"This place is a lovely little gem away from the real world. Even though it is outdoor cabins the heater worked great and although it rained for hours and hours it was still lovely to be all cosy and watch a film. The kitchen has all you need for cooking and the local shop, though a bit pricey, has excellent meat. We cooked it on the little BBQ provided and had a great time sitting on the porch watching the rain. There's also a video player and an excellent selection of actual VHS tapes, which made me very happy. 
Of course, the most unusual and special detail is the outdoor bath. Once it stopped raining we ran a lovely hot midnight candlelit bath (candles provided too!) and it was just amazing out in the middle of the countryside. 
Phone reception is not good here but great if you want to switch off from the world. 
The place is a little tricky to find but Stuart was on hand to help us find it and a very welcoming host. He made sure we had everything we needed and the view over the river is lovely.
The next day we headed to the nearby lake which has stunning views and impressive dam.

Stuart himself was very friendly and welcoming.
The accommodation was more or less what we expected, and the bathtub under the stars exceeded my expectations and is something I won't soon forget. So in that sense BOOK IT.
However, the place needs a very good clean. We've stayed in similar cabins before, and we're certainly not fussy.
But apart from the many cobwebs and mustiness in the bedrooms, the cooker and counter were sticky, all the teacups stained, and the fridge hasn't been cleaned in a good while. There were sponges and a dishcloth, but even those were old and dirty.
Also I'm not sure if we were supposed to ask Stuart for breakfast, but there wasn't anything provided. There was a pack of tea amongst the sticky bottles of spices, and that was it. We asked for coffee and sugar (and later, hot chocolate) and Stuart couldn't have been more generous. I don't know if he was caught unprepared, but judging by other comments, this is the norm.
My friend and I would stay again as we're fairly easy in that sense, and it is a wonderful experience, but I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending the accommodation to anyone else.",4

5289,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rob,"Stuart's cabins are beautifully situated. We loved the bath and the setting. However... My main gripe is that the place was not clean. In fact, I would describe it as absolutely filthy. I do not have particularly high standards and we had expected cobwebs and a bit of muck, but this was simply something else. None of the floors had been swept and all the sheds had grass and muck all over the floors. The kitchen was simply filthy with a cooker with someone else's food still all over it and a fridge with crumbs and sticky stuff on the shelves. The pans had been washed up but had food debris on them and the cutlery was covered in grease. The tables were sticky. The cutlery tray was simply disgusting. Even the kettle was horrible. We went out the second day and bought some cheap stuff to cook and eat with. In one bedroom and the treehouse the basins looked as if they had not been cleaned for months - this was truly foul. One bed had a plate of congealed food under and another a crisp packet. The treehouse had a bin full of rubbish and everything in it was covered in grime. I had planned to let my children sleep in here and they were disappointed that I stopped them. All the bed linen was old and not properly clean and in one cabin the bed really damp. The really disconcerting thing was that when Stuart arrived with an effusive welcome he seemed genuinely taken aback that we found the place unacceptable. He was genial and friendly but did not apologise or offer to clean the place properly. He even commented to another of our party (my elderly mother) that I was ""a right barrel of laughs,"" which I thought very rude considering I had been extremely polite to him despite being bitterly disappointed with the place. I should point out that my mother was herself so upset with the grim state that she offered to pay for us to go to a hotel, but was too polite to say anything to Stuart herself. On the second day my eldest, 9, woke and sat up in the top bunk to find herself covered in cobwebs (and this was not just a tiny one in a corner - this was months of no cleaning). My 5 year-old lost her bedsock under the bottom bunk and came out covered in dust and grime and cried. This was just horrible. My own shed was no better. Could Stuart maybe clean the windows once in a while? This was like the inside of a garden shed after some years of spiders and dirt. If you now wonder whether I may just be a complaining, cleanliness-obsessed idiot then please get in touch and I will send you some photos. We live in an old and crumbly house in a very rural area and are used to basic facilities and a lack of modern...",2

I asked him where was the lake and he actually drove me there to show me which I thought was very kind. The surroundings are brilliant, the tree house fab. Stuart even lit up a nice fire pit in the evening for me and I just sat in the hot tub bath with lots of candles around me listening to peaceful music.

When we finally got there we were amazed at how beautiful it was. The pictures are great but don't do it justice. It's secluded, idyllic and a million miles away from this fast paced life we have to live. I would definitely recommend this place if you're after seclusion, peace or a romantic time. Stargazing in a hot tub was a beautiful experience when having no light pollution, you could even see the cosmic dust. The bed in the main bedroom is fantastically comfy too.

If your expecting centre parks - look elsewhere!

If your looking for a relaxing, different , off the beaten track, getting away from it all ""glamping"" experience - this is for you!

We loved it, despite the cold wet weather, we can't wait to return. 

Stewart was great, made us feel comfortable and welcome.

Loved sitting outside toasting hot Cross buns on the open fire.  

The vhs collection was great, loved laying in bed watching videos. 

Our only issue was the very rough track to the property. Stewart had warned us, but even our Audi A3 was scraping the underside. Really a 4x4 is needed unless the track is levelled a little.

We will return!

5327,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Peter And Rosie,"Although we only met briefly due to us arrivingly late and leaving early Stuart was kind and helpful.
The area is stunning and if you just want to get away from it all this is the place for you !
The area is beautiful and the lake stunning.
We slept in the main bedroom which was lovely and cosy and had a great nights sleep.
The kitchen is basic but has a microwave and a double hob so basic meals are the order of the day, think camping and you will not go far wrong.
Just wrap up warm , open a bottle of wine put on your favourite music ( you will need to supply music ) and chill out under the stars or inside the cosy bedroom.

The scenery was stunning and bathing in all weathers (including snow!) was incredible. We came prepared with lots of layers as it gets quite cold but the cabin we slept in was very cosy and we really enjoyed choosing our vhs selection for the weekend. The kitchen was a bit cold but it was fine for making big breakfasts in the morning before heading out. Stuart was really helpful and invited us in for a cuppa. We would really recommend a stay here for a wild and wonderful adventure.,5

Despite the cold and rainy March day we used the outdoor shower that night. Without outdoor light and only candle light it, made the whole experience  perfect. 

Phone signal out there is spotty at best, so we were cut off from the world, which was relaxing.

We recommend to get to his place before it gets dark, as that will make it harder to navigate especially when it is raining.

We had a great time and we will be back.",5

Just a few minutes drive from the beautiful Lake Vyrnwy, Stuart's accommodation is tucked away amongst the Welsh forest. The main cabin (which is where we stayed) is warm, cosy and comfortable. The outdoor shower is fantastic, the sauna is a brilliant experience but the outdoor bath under the starlight is the best of all - unbelievable! 

Stuart was a great host, attending to every need and even inviting us in for a drink. We will definitely be returning!",5
5335,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Luke,"What can I say, Stuart was the best host and the reviews about him are 100% accurate. He makes sure that you have everything you need and will go above and beyond.

He makes sure he is around when you need him but gives you the space you want so you can feel like you have your own private getaway.

His plan is amazing, the log cabins and tree house are wonderly crafted and makes you have the best outdoors experience. If you like the outdoor, camping and the beauty of nature, this place is for you.

If you are expecting the Ritz with not a spec of dirt of dust then save yourself some time and Stuart's time. This is a back to nature experience, you have a heated room, Kitchen with hot water, sink etc and amenities but it will be cold, there will be some cobwebs and sheep. That is the best part about it!

When we looked at other reviews we heard about the VHS collection and what a collection. Of course in the valleys in Wales you won't pick up any signal, wifi or television but you can watch over 100 classic movies.

The best part about the trip is the outdoor bath. We never got to gaze at the stars as it was cloudy but being outdoors in a bath sunk into the hillside, there is nothing more perfect with a drink and some candle light.

If you are looking to get away for the weekend with a fab host who was helpful, in a place with picturesque views away from the busy day to day life, stay here...you won't regret it.",5

The smaller details such as the outdoor bath, the pile of VHS cassettes & ample collection of tealights really charmed myself and my girlfriend. The road getting in was quite undulating so be sure to bring a car that has adequate ground clearance!

Stuart was very helpful - offering bikes & assistance when possible. He started the outdoor fire which was much needed out in the cold but actually the interior warmth was more than sufficient. Overall a great place to stay! Thanks Stuart. ",5

We stayed in the large cabin adjacent to the kitchenette. It was clean, tidy, (warm) and piled sky-high with a brilliant selection of video tapes. The bathing facilities are basic but all work splendidly; a great shower with plenty of hot water and a unique outdoor bathtub, (great with candles, a bottle of bubbly and a Lush bathbomb!) The kitchen was functional and kitted out with a gas stove, sink, fridge, kettle, microwave and all kitchen equipment needed for basic cooking (no toaster though.) Stuart was a great host and touched base with us to ensure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. We truly had a fantastic trip and would recommend Stuart's place to anyone wanting to explore the beautiful Welsh countryside in a picturesque and unique setting. ",5

The outdoor bath was a highlight, with plenty of hot water available.  The cabin we slept in had a huge collection of classic VHS tapes to watch, and was nice and cosy.  It's a little bit isolated so don't make our mistake if you're arriving in the evening, and remember to bring some food with you! The local shop closes at 6 and the next nearest place with a big shop is a 30 minute drive away, this is no slight on Stuart's place, just a tip from a couple of fools that didn't bring any dinner! Stuart is a very friendly and accommodating host, but he's more than happy to leave you to it once you're all set up and ready to go.Overall we'd highly recommend staying here if you like a unique and rugged experience in a fun and isolated place.

We visited in January so yes it was cold. Even woke up to snow the next morning. We had a lovely evening in front of the fire pit and thoroughly enjoyed the sauna. Stuart is a lovely host and worked hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay. 
We were encouraged to enjoy the local area and we very much did. The local rspb site was amazing. 
We found the kitchen to be a bit too cold to sit in which was a shame but it did not bother us too much. 
The beds are super comfy and warm once you settle in.  We all had a great nights sleep. 
Showering in the snow was a first time experience for us. 
I would definitely recommend staying here for the unique experience. 
If you visit in the colder months then go prepared as the accommodation is geared to the outdoor lifestyle. Warm clothes are a must. 
We look forward to visiting in the warmer months. 
Thank you for being such a good host Stuart.

5353,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kevin,"Be warned this is very basic accommodation. We went  for a long weekend in November from Thursday night to Sunday, However we left Saturday morning as description not accurate.
Stuart the host is very amiable and very helpful always checking to see if your ok. The views are stunning. those are the good points.
These are not LOG cabins they are large sheds, there is no living space so you are confined to your bed I know we went in November but the convector heater in the main shed is not adequate unless you have multiple layers on. 
No heating in Kitchen so eating in there was not possible and if more then 2 of you there is no room.
Outside shower is no more then an area between the 2 sheds with a shower door put on and you stand on a concrete slab after you clear all the leaves and muck away.
Sauna and outside BBQ were not used as they needed a quite a fierce heat to get them started.
A small point is that all rooms have TV's but there is no signal so you have vhs videos to watch.
Woke up on Saturday morning to no hot water, which was the last straw so we left.
This is not a reflection on Stuart, just the accommodation. ",2

5355,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Corinna,"We stayed one night at the cabin. If your looking for something out of a hoseasons catalogue, then this is not for you.  However if your looking for a beautiful cabin, with plenty of space to share with your nearest and dearest or just get away from it all, with its beautiful rustic charm,then this is the place for you!
From everything from the wood burung sauna, up cycled firepit, to the outdoor bath, the whole place leaves you feeling completely relaxed. It is set in beautiful surroundings and during our stay we were lucky enough to use the outside bath, starring up into the clear night sky and see 2 shooting stars! 
Stuart was a great host and had time to come and chat with us and he couldn't be more helpful. Bottom line is we will be returning for more than 1 night next time.
One thing I would say is make sure you go in suitable transport, as a lowered sports car, isn't the most practical mode of transport down the track to Stuart's place. ",5

5366,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Shelley,"Stuart's place is so much fun and very well equipped! It's warm and cozy, the scenery is breathtaking and there's lots to do in the area. Stuart kindly took us on a woodland drive to the local pub and we saw the sunset over the lake. We had a fees beers round the fire and then watched old movies on the VCR. In the morning I had my coffee in the outdoor bath tub which is set in to the hillside overlooking the woodland (really hot water!) and then we went to see the waterfall and lake in the afternoon. Great night away wish we could have stayed longer! ",5

The outside shower is invigorating and it was wonderful waking up with nature right outside your window.  Wished we had taken marshmallows for the fire that our host kindly lit for us.  Hamish the female black cat is very friendly but can give you a fright!,5

The location is amazing and the cabin is so cosy! The outdoor bath tub and sauna were highlights too. Stuart was a really great host- he even lent us bikes for a lovely cycle around lake Vyrwnn.  ,5
5372,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Luke,"Stuart's place is simply fantastic and exactly what it says on the tin. If you like quirky and different, then this is the place for you. Located in a lovely little valley close to Lake Vyrnwy, you wake up to the sound of birds and the nearby stream. 
Stuart was an excellent host, very accommodating and friendly, even though we were running late on arrival. He made sure we had everything we needed, showing us how to use the homemade sauna (sow-na!), hot bath and other amenities. A fantastic host, and not over-bearing. 
Really hot water is available any time for the outdoor bath and shower, so don't worry about that. ",5
5373,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Shane,"We could not have had a better time at Stuart's place if a magic genie had come down and offered us 3 wishes. The cabins are amazing, clean, wholesome and tucked away in the most beautiful of surroundings nestled in a forestry valley with the sound of a stream flowing below. We had an enchanting evening with Stuart and his friends, exchanging songs and stories. Everything was just so easy and relaxing and we will definitely be returning in the future when it's time to get away from it all again. It's a short drive to the amazing lake Vyrnwy where one can walk to the amazing waterfalls. Stuart is an amazing host and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed as well as providing an evening of wonderful entertainment. The piece de resistance for me is an outdoor bathtub with hot water where one can relax under the stars. Thank you Stuart and see you again :)",5

5375,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Hannah,"I have no idea how to sum up my stay here in the space provided. I'm not sure I can do the log cabin, Sky pod, outdoor shower and bath, location and most particularly Stuart, justice. 
What a host! What a place!

All I can say is everything was perfect right from the start. I slept soundly and woke up to the sound of the river. Stuart took me to meet his friends at the local and had a cold beer ready when I got back from a loooooong bike ride around the lake (this is a must!!)

What Stuart has created is mind blowing and if you are thinking about going ... Don't think. Just go. Even the cleanliness of the outdoor toilet  would put most bathrooms to shame. The facilities including the kitchen are everything you will need!

Spending time here was like staying at a second home - that's how welcome Stuart and his friends (thanks Shan) make you feel!

Make sure you check out Di the  dragon!!

I will be back for sure! 
Thanks for a great holiday Stuart!!!",5
5376,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sarah,Stuart's place is tucked away so if you're looking for remote with a running river at the bottom of the garden then look no further.  3 cabins (all individually created by Stuart) and a lovely tree house (great for kids !) sit overlooking wooded slopes.  I wanted to get away from everything and this was certainly the place.  Basic but comfortable and clean.  Stuart has made himself a lovely home here.,4

He was a wonderful host, he met us when we were lost, he took us on a tour to see the lake and dam. Stuart was there for anything you needed but also gave you your space when you wanted it. The cabins themselves were great, really well equipped and all bedding and towels were provided.  The sauna was awesome, it got really hot quickly and it was easy to maintain. The outdoor bath and shower was a nice touch and definitely something to experience no matter the weather (we bathed at midnight in the rain :)). All in all a excellent night away and would recommend it to anyone. Can't wait to stay again and will stay for longer.",5

Had beautiful clear skies and no light pollution so it was lovely to make a fire and sit out looking at the stars. Just wished we had had more time!,5
5381,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Pippa,"Absolutely LOVED our stay with Stuart. From the outdoor bath and washing machine drum fire, to the old school video movie selection and cosy kitchen, the place was perfect. Certainly not glamping but far more interesting and unusual. Could have happily stayed all week! Also a lovely surrounding area with plenty to see and do. Will be recommending it to our friends and hope to be back with a group again soon! ",5
5382,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Deborah,"Stuart's place is something unique that neither I, nor my husband or son will forget! From Saunas, to old style videos, to outdoor showers and baths, to unique (and sometimes scary!) d√©cor, Stuart's place delivers on fun, frivolity, getting back to nature and just chilling out.  Its hard to describe the feeling of running between the sauna and outdoor bath in the rain, listening to the wind in the trees and river below and taking in the view of the forest. Stuart himself is a true gent, kind and patient when we got lost and generous in his time showing us the lovely dam.  Also a really interesting and creative guy with lots of stories to tell.  Place is hard to find so read his directions before you leave as hard to get mobile connection (I didn't!).  Also bring your groceries with you as there is only one corner shop that you need to drive to.  This place is out of the way but it is one you will not regret going to especially if you have children.  This place is what memories are made of!  Thanks Stuart....loved it! x",5
5383,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Amy,"A fantastic and unique place with a warm and welcoming host!

Great value too!",4
5385,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Arian,"Stuart gave us a warm welcome upon arrival, and helped us get settled in.

The place consists of several cabins with great little details sprinkled all over. The view of the stream is beautiful, and can be greatly enjoyed from the outside shower or bath.

It's a good place for a BBQ and sitting around the fire, enjoying the view of the woods, and the stars at night. 

The treehouse and porch are fantastic extra's that make the whole thing even more special.

Stuart is a kind host who does his best to make your stay enjoyable. He has great knowledge of the sites around, such as the lake and dam.",4

A completely liberating experience, the one and only time I have laid in a bath watching shooting stars... 
Unforgettable :) 
",5
5387,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Leigh,"We (myself and friend) stayed for one night at Stuart's place, but both said we wished we could have stayed for longer. I chose this place as I liked the description of the cabins and sauna, and found that everything was as described, only even better! If you are used to outdoor living/camping but want a bit of luxury for a change, this will be perfect for you. If you are new to camping, this will suit you too, as we were amazed at all the mod-cons laid on - electric lights, HOT running water, plumbed in flushing toilet, yet all within a beautiful, peaceful valley, with the sounds of running water and owls at night. I particularly loved the outdoor bath, watching the clouds scudding past and the moon rising through the trees. The attention to detail that Stuart has put in is incredible, everything has been thought of to make your stay as comfortable and practical as possible. Stuart set up the fire for us when we arrived and was friendly and welcoming. We loved our stay here and would definitley recomend it.",5
5388,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Peter,Second time staying at Stuarts place and wish we'd had time to stay longer. Stuart is always a welcoming host and great company. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area.,5
5389,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Zoe,Stuart has an incredibly wicked sense of humour and you can tell by the accommodation offered. The shower was one of the best I have ever had and we regret we didn't have a bath too!!!  You will know what I mean the minute you arrive.  The location is stunning as Lake Vyrnwy and we absolutely loved our short stay.  Stuart went the extra mile and even gave me my first experience of a quad bike. We were invited to join him for dinner at the Taverna and Stuart doubled as a Taxi driver as well as a host. We were very grateful. A great stay and much fun.,5
5390,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Tom,Stuart could not have done more to make us feel welcome. He went above and beyond even driving us to where the wedding venue was! Amazing setting and a bath set into the decking to enjoy it all from. Very memorable stay. Thank you.,5

5393,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Hannah,"I booked the cabins for myself and 5 friends as a girls weekend. Stuart was a fantastic host, half of our party arrived late on the first night and he was still around to greet us. All the cabins were very comfortable and homely. I can safely say the most picturesque and relaxing bath I've had! I would definitely return and recommend to others. Thank you! ",5

Would highly recommend. A special place.",4
5397,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Claire,"Stuart was a great host, he made us feel very welcome. He was happy to get the campfire going for us, and kindly lent us his cafetiere. There were candles everywhere which was a nice touch. The cabin we stayed in looked out on a ravine, very private and secluded and we enjoyed the soothing sound of the stream. There was plenty of hot water which was a real bonus when camping. Stuart was also full of suggestions for things to do while in the area. There are some very pretty walks around the lake, a waterfall walk which we particularly enjoyed, and the cafe/restaurant at the Lake Vyrnwy Hotel is a must visit for the views.",4
5398,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Huw,"Stuart was a great host. He helped us settle in really well.
The location is stunning. Unfortunately we were only here for one night so my daughter didn't get to sleep in the treehouse!",4
5399,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Claire,"This place was a serene, beautiful spot in what felt like the middle of nowhere (in the best way).

The photos of the place realy dont do it justice, its way more beautifull! The balcony at night, with all its fairy lights and funny knick knacks, Stuart making the fires for us, the midnight bath with plenty of water, the walks, envirinment and the sauna that Stuart lit up for us, it was a fantastic experiance and will be coming again! Even when it rained the second night we entertained ourselves perfectly in the sauna with a cold bath afterwards! Highly recomended for people who love being outdoors, funny, interesting, quircky things and a 10/10 for us!!",5
5401,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,John,An absolutely perfect little getaway. Well equipped for all you need.

Perfect location, and some real peace and quiet.  Stuart's cabin offer exactly what we needed after a long day on the bikes. Outdoor bath and shower are brilliant for soaking off the day. We'll be back when we're next in the area. Thanks again.",5

5404,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Miriam,"Had a lovely stay here with my two daughters. Stuart was very welcoming and had lots of information about places to visit locally. He made us feel that we were free to explore and use the new tree house, swings and his own decking area as well as the log cabins. We were cosy and warm at night and made use of the outdoor bath; a fabulous experience lying in hot water listening to owls across the valley. Stuart lit the fire for us one evening and invited us over to have a drink with friends on another evening. The kitchen had everything we needed and made life easier. Overall, staying at Stuart's is a bit like glamping with the added bonus of videos to watch! ",4
5405,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sourabh,"it was not about the uniqueness of the cottage which will remain in our memories but the warmth and guidance of our host Stuart. Whether it is setting up our Sauna bath early in the morning or helping us in our bar-be-que in the night, he was always available. 
The place is undoubtedly the most appealing of all sites I have stayed in UK. Be it the open bath under the stars or the Sauna, every room had its own video player which was quite nostalgic. A big big thank to Stuart for making our stay memorable",5
5406,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Caroline,"Absolutely LOVED this break away! The log cabins were cosy, well equipped, and the little kitchen is fantastic! We spent the time sat by a fire overlooking the beautiful river and watching the birds and sheep, in the sauna (AMAZING!!!), and then in the fantastic outside bath and shower! The hot water is HOT and plentiful! It's a cabin, so there are a few outdoorsy things (the odd cobweb and moth) but this is ultimate glamping! 
The candles are plentiful, the electricity is useful (!!!), the beds are so comfortable and the setting is just amazing! Stuart is so friendly and couldn't do enough for us, recommending places and walks to go! 
We'll definitely be coming back!!!",5
5407,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sadaf,"It was a magical experience, ideal for city children (and parents) to appreciate being close to nature. Nearby Lake Vrynwy was a fantastic walking area. Stuart was a kind, generous and inspiring host. The sound of the river was a constant pleasure at the log cabins. Sauna awesome. Open air shower ace.",5
5408,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Melissa,"Stuart was lovely, extremely welcoming and couldn't do enough to help. He took us for a drive over the mountain to the lake in his own car, and also made an excellent tour guide. 

The settling is beautiful. The sauna and bath are amazing, as is the outside shower. The kitchen is fairly well stocked. Beds are comfortable and the cabins stayed fairly warm. It was nice getting nostalgic with the videos - can't remember when I last watched one of those! 

Definitely highly recommended! ",5
5409,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Luc,"Me and my partner Cheryl had a fabulous time in the log cabin. Stuart made us feel very very welcome and was a fantastic host throughout. The place is amazing, sauna...outside bath...loads of interesting things around, open space, stars.

The log cabins are a wonderful place to connect with nature. It was chilly in the morning but very comfortable in the bed under the double duvet.
The sauna, external shower and external bathtub were also very pleasant given the chilly weather because the hot water is very hot and comes out quickly.",5
5412,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Jiten,Stuart welcomed us very nicely on our arrival and gave us a lovely tour of the setup he has. The area in which this cabin is situated is fabulous and the cabins themselves were beautiful. Stuart was very kind and helped out whenever we had questions. He was also kind enough to assist with a surprise I had planned for my girlfriend. This is an awesome place to visit and I would love to go back again in the summer.,4
5413,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Richard,"Excellent stay, really welcoming. We loved the outside bath to relax in after the long drive up. Already planning when we can come back in the summer to enjoy the treehouse!",5
5414,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Artur,"Staying at Stuart's cabin is an experience. It is somewhere on the scale between a fully equip home and camping, so much like glamping. We all loved the experience, the finish Sauna, the out door hot tube and cooking on the barbecue. 

The fact that there was no mobile signal was an added bonus for me. And wifi is only available at Stuart's place, making the cabin ideal to getaway from the stresses of modern life. The setting is truly beautiful, with the views from the cabin looking on to a woodland around a small valley (that Stuart owns!). There are many outdoor activities and walks close by.

The man Stuart himself is a great host, very flexible and concerned with our well being (when we went for a walk in a storm he went looking for us!). If you're lucky he'll tell you one of his many interesting stories. ",5
5415,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Andrea,Stuart was fantastic. Loved the cabins. Unfortunately we arrived late in the evening and had to leave first thing the next morning. We would have loved to have spent a few days enjoying the area. ,5
5416,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Cheryl Hannah,"Stuart was extremely kind and looked after my sister and myself like his own! Because we didn't drive, he offered to take us around and showed us the beautiful parts of Wales - it was absolutely stunning beyond our expectations. He also invited us over to his place for a glass of wine next to his fireplace with his delightful cat curled up by our feet. The cabin was of a cosy and rustic build that Stuart put together himself!! There was a river running right at our doorstep of the cabin. It was most incredibly to wake up to the sounds of water rushing through the river, birds chirping and trees rustling. There was also a treehouse near the cabin which he just completed at the end of our trip. ",4
5417,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Mike,"Hidden away in the hills, The cabins are a great hideaway for a couples retreat or a group visit. Visiting in February, it was cold on the evening making the showering an experience! With what seemed to be an unlimited supply of hot water we had no trouble keeping warm in there- it was getting out which proved to be difficult. Alternately there is the outdoor bath but we opted to get  in the Sauna as quickly as possible, and stayed there for the rest of the night. 

Stuart was very welcoming. Upon arrival we realized we forgot the tonic for our gin so instead of pointing us to the local shop, we were welcomed into his home for a drink and to be provided with a bottle of tonic. We also received a tour of his amazing home!

Will hopefully be visiting again in the summer to make the most of the outdoor area and maybe even the tree house!",5
5418,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Steve,"Despite arriving in awful weather we really enjoyed our stay here, the location is remote and beautiful. We took shelter from the rain in a cafe on Lake Vyrnwy, took a drive around the lake and had a decent meal at the Lake Vyrnwy hotel a few miles away.
The cabin was warm enough for February, clean and comfortable and the outdoor bath was amazing - even with the rain drizzling on our faces.
Stuart is an extremely kind and accommodating host, giving you privacy when needed but also happy to have a chat and a drink if you want.
Would recommend this place to anyone.",5
5419,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Alexander,"Stuart‚Äôs cabins are amazing and include what is almost certainly the best bathtub in the UK. They are set very close to a riverbank and listening to the sound of the water while looking up at the innumerous stars while sitting in a deep, hot bath was the best possible way I could think of to round off a day in this particularly beautiful and rugged part of the UK. Despite the howling wind and rain the cabin was comfortable, warm and clean and we both slept very soundly. I should also mention that Stuart himself could not have been kinder or more welcoming and we will without doubt be back later on this year!",5
5420,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Nath,"Fantastic experience. Stuart has built three cabins, which was perfect for our group of five. The whole set up is really unique, at the top of a valley with a river running nearby and a whole lot of peace and quiet. 

We stayed over New Years, so it was a bit cold out. However we were able to warm up with the heaters in the cabin, and with the homemade sauna and bath tub. All great features! 

One area for improvement in heating terms is that the second cabin, with the bunk beds, was a bit colder than the other two cabins. Meaning we ended up having four to a double bed in the warmer room. This was fine for us, but could be improved in the future for other winter guests (wouldn't be a problem in summer).

Would highly recommend the experience if you're looking for a peaceful retreat in nature. ",5
5421,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Helen,"Had a fabulous time at Stuarts cabins, staying 3 days between Xmas and New year. The bedroom cabin is very cosy and being able to make use of the home built sauna and outdoor bath and shower (loads of hot water) was really relaxing and the icing on the cake. The surroundings are lovely and very peaceful with the cabins looking out over river and trees. This place was better than expected and I would highly recommend.",5
5422,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,David,"Stuart was extremely welcoming and patient with us while we tried to find his place. We were delayed due to traffic and a missing bag at the airport, which made us arrive extremely late. However, Stuart was very kind about it, and was very patient with us while we navigated the rural roads to try to find his place. If you follow his directions, it isn't too difficult to find, even in the dark! Just don't follow your GPS!

Stuart also provided us with great information about the surrounding area and fun nature walks to do. The next night, even though it was very late, he was kind enough to setup his sauna and the outdoor bath under the stars for us. Even in winter, the room was toasty and warm, and the setting was beautiful. However, we will certainly try to return in the summer months!

These cabins are so nice and quaint, in such a beautiful area, and the listing is definitely as described, but even better. The photos really don't do the area justice.",5

We Got there late (9pm ish) and he got the fire going as well as the sauna. Perfect end to the day.

The cabins were great and if you want a different experience to being in a hotel and prefer being out in the wildes, this is just the ticket. Make sure to go and see the near by lake.

I'll definitely be going back and that says it all really.

When we returned Stuart had put the heaters on for us and all or stuff in the cabin as previous occupiers were still there when we left. It was nice to come back to warmth as it was a rather chilly night. Got a great nights sleep after watching a quick episode of only fools and horses. In the morning Stuart lent me his phone as my mobile got zero signal so I could ring the hotel to check for my lost jacket. Nothing seems to be a hassle for Stuart, very friendly and hospitable!",5

It is such a fabulous place in the most wonderful location. Stuart was extremely kind, helpful and friendly. He couldn't have been a better host, ensuring that my friends and I had a great experience. There are too many positives to mention, but the fab views, the outdoor bath and shower and the great skydeck with its smoking dragon are some that come to mind.",5

We will definitely be returning!",5
5438,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Marie-Louise,"The approach to the cabins was certainly out of the ordinary, so much so that we weren't sure if we were at the right place! Stuart assured us we were and invited us in for a cup of tea. This is camping but with the comfort of a real bed and heater if the night is a bit chilly plus the added advantage of not having to deal with soggy canvas and damp things which we certainly would have done if we had been in a tent as we had some real downpours. It was lovely to look across at all the trees from our warm dry cabin. We are not talking five star luxury here so if it is glamping you are after then look elsewhere. You would however be missing out on the fabulous outdoor shower not to mention the bath! Stuart was very kind providing toys for our grandson and making sure everything was OK. He even lit the chimenea for my daughter and son in law (they stayed a bit longer and had the good weather). They said it was lovely to sit in the sky pod under the stars, they also took full advantage of bathing under the night sky too. Stuart's cabins are quite unique, not flash or super sophisticated, kitchen equipment is fairly minimal e.g. bring a sharp knife and other bits and pieces if you are wanting to rustle up flash meals. A stay in the cabins will however provide you with a very memorable holiday experience.",4

5440,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Julie,"This place is completely  bonkers but in a very good way. We had so much fun: a lovely walk by the river, dinner outdoors overlooking the wild landscape, piping hot al fresco bubble baths, drinks and a nice chat with our host on the treetop deck by a roaring chiminea fire... My daughter enjoyed the eclectic selection of videos in the cabins and we all liked the quirky way the cabins have been put together. 
It is several notches up from camping but still a great back-to-basics experience.",5
5441,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Nicole,"Stuart was a great host, and made lots of effort to stay in touch before we arrived, ensuring that we knew how to locate the property and that we had enough beds, etc.
He went out of his way during our stay, to help out with a flat tyre, moving the car for us and fitting the spare, which allowed for us to continue with our plans to visit the local hotel for a spa treatment. This was so helpful of him and a testament to his kind nature.",4

The cabins are set in beautiful grounds and there is everything you need for a perfect holiday retreat. It certainly is different in the best possible way. The outside bath was a real plus for the children who were both sorry to leave.

The host, Stuart, is a friendly, warm character who is also extremely helpful and made sure we had everything we needed.

We will be going back and hopefully it will be sooner rather than later. 

Many thanks Stuart for a lovely break.",5

5445,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Stephanie,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been written. We just returned from 3 nights at Stuart's cabin and had a wonderful time. As others have said, it's very rustic - don't go if you're expecting 5* luxury. However, it's in a beautiful location, you have everything you need, and Stuart is a kind, welcoming, and friendly host. He's happy to sit and have a drink and a chat, and is more than happy for you to have a wander through his property, where you can wander through meadows, visit sheep and wallabies, and see the beautiful river Vyrnwy. However, he also gives you your space. It's the perfect mix of company and privacy, and he's a lovely, engaging person to talk to. 
We didn't end up trying out the sauna, but the tub under the stars was amazing, and we were able to cook simple meals easily in the small kitchen. 
The location of the cabin is perfect; only a few minutes' drive from Lake Vyrnwy, close to Snowdonia, and not too far from the coast either. Stuart is happy to give recommendations on nice places to visit; we took his advice each day, and weren't disappointed!
We'd happily go back any time, and wholeheartedly recommend Stuart's cabin to anyone wanting either a rustic cabin getaway, or a fun glamping experience. ",5

5448,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Karen,"Stuart is a wonderful host- genuine, helpful and friendly .   Staying here was a bit like upscale camping- in the middle of nature, with a fantastic view and the sound of the river running at the bottom of the hill!  Kitchen facilities are fairly basic, but we managed fine, cooking ourselves a couple of meals and enjoyed them on the picnic bench outside.  Though we visited in July, the rain set in making it cold in the evenings, but the cabin was nice and warm.  The outside shower was hot, powerful and good fun, especially in the rain and the outside bath with a starry night and candles was wonderful! There was plenty to do in the local area and Stuart gave us great advice.  The local shop is a bit pricey so stock up on basics before you arrive.  We're looking forward to visiting again soon and trying the wood burning sauna which we didn't have time to do this time. ",5
5449,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Lottie,Stuart's place in the welsh wilderness was wonderful.  The countryside nearby is stunning and it's only a half hour drive to national park.  We climbed up Cadair Idris on Stuart's recommendation - walkers said it's as impressive as Snowdon with half the tourists. Be prepared that the cabin is just that and you will need to bring some kitchen supplies if you want to make elaborate meals.  You also need to make friends with the beasties as you're in the wilds of Wales after all.  The bedroom is super comfy and the outdoor shower is much better than it sounds. Would love to come back.,4
5450,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Jason,"A friend and I stayed in Stuart's log cabins this week, whilst on a motorbike tour of Wales, and I honestly don't think I could have found a nicer place.  A warm greeting from Stuart as we rode down the lane set the scene, and we found him both engaging to chat to and eager to show us around.  He should is justly proud of what he has achieved - the location is stunning, and the peace and tranquillity it offers was well worth the wait.

Stuart has clearly enjoyed putting together the eclectic mix of cabins and ornamentation, which were fully equipped, warm, comfortable and wonderfully different.  The outdoor bathtub, with a seemingly endless supply of piping hot water, was something to experience.  A beer in the hand, and a view of the stars whilst soaking off the soreness of a day on the bike was a great way to relax.

The whole experience took me back to days of my youth where holidays were all about camping.  If you're expecting fine dining and polished brass bed knobs, stay somewhere else; if, however, you want an experience you'll be talking about for years to come, and want to stay somewhere where you'll be looking forward to going back to, then look no further.  We're already planning our next biking trip, and will be sure to stop in for another night at Stuart's cabins.",5
5451,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Claire,"Excellent location for exploring the area - walks from the front door. Stuart is an attentive and helpful host. The outside bath was brilliant - soaking in the sunshine overlooking the trees and stream can't be beaten for location. The shower, again outdoors, was hot and powerful.  The cooking facilities are basic but we managed to prepare meals with a bit of improvisation. It was great waking up to the view and to listen to the birdsong. ",4
5452,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Richard,"Stuart was a great and warm host who looked after our every need whilst we stayed in one of his log cabins.
 
Me and my uncle arrived in a electric car and found it almost impossible to commute around Wales running off electric power only because of a lack of electric charging stations. Stuart plugged us in to a mains on his property so we could put the car on a very slow charge and even dropped us off at the local hotel/bar a few miles away both nights we were there which really has amazing views of Lake Vyrnwy. 

Stuarts place overlooks a small valley within a huge valley which is very scenic. Just sitting looking over the view from the cabins you can see lots of wildlife about. The general area around his place is very impressive and very rural.

About his cabins. Very clean and very warm!  He has a full functional kitchen as well as a outside toilet, hot shower and bath.

Bath? Yes bath. Probably one of the best you will ever have. I find it amazing that the host didn't make this the central selling point of his property. It is amazing simply put. Imagine a deep hot filled bath on the edge of a valley looking up at the Milky Way? Well, it was cloudy the night I took a bath but it was still amazing!

The cabins seat 2 each generally. All are clean and very warm. My bed was very cosy as well. The nights I stayed dropped as low as -1C in June! I was warm all night!

A few things about Stuart. He is a little eccentric but a very clever and humble guy. If he reads this I will point out the skeletons with LED lights holding Whiskey bottles lining his drive or the 120+ VHS 80's movies on shelves in the cabin I stayed in available to watch. The outside bath (which is amazing) or his Wallaby's on his land running about. 

All in all such a great host who I cannot praise enough for introducing me to this very scenic and quiet part of Wales as well as being accommodating above and beyond. 

I am planning on running a photography weekend in the area soon and this will be the base for 6 of us. Rhiwargor Waterfall 7 miles away and Lake Vyrnwy 2 miles away are some of the best landscapes to see in the UK. 

5/5 will return again!

The walks are beautiful, the lake is incredible and to top it off Stuart's impressive handmade wooden cabin, kitchen, sauna, sky pod and out door bath are all amazing! 
After a day of walking through the fields and mountains taking in the scenery and maybe even renting a canoe on the lake which is ¬£15 for 1 hour and totally worth doing! Then imagine going back to Stuart's to enjoy a warm bath out side looking up at the stars just forgetting about everything and feeling complete relaxation. You truly do get the impression you're in a different country with the scenery and the wallabies hopping around in their pen (Stuart has three wallabies which was nice to go and see an animal id never seen before) 
Stuart himself is a fantastic host, always on hand to help you with anything you may need, living less than 100 yards away and his house and the cabins are separated by the car park and a small incline so you have complete privacy at all times when in the cabin and using the outside bath and shower. 

I'll end on, the pictures really do not do this place justice and you just have to go there to understand how awesome it really is! ",5

The cabin and adjoining kitchen were very clean, cozy and had everything we needed. The outdoor bath was an extremely well received addition after a long day of hiking.

5467,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Jenny,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Stuarts over Valentines weekend - and wow, what a weekend! Even before we arrived, Stuart made us feel right at home with his exceptional communication and by providing very helpful directions (without which we would have got even more lost!). As soon as we arrived in the surrounding area we knew we were in for a treat as even in cloudy February weather the views were beautiful. After arriving at Stuarts, we were given a tour of our accommodation and shown where everything was - the kitchen and bathroom are both very well kept and have all amenities advertised.

As for the cabin itself, we would have to agree with other reviewers, Stuarts pictures simply do not do them justice. We stayed in the bigger of the two rooms which was simply furnished with an amazing heater which kept the room super warm even in winter and two single beds (which were kindly pushed together) which had the most amazingly comfy duvet. The room also has a TV and VHS player which provides a nice vintage touch and allowed us to snuggle in bed watching some old classic videos which have also been provided. The cabin overlooks a view of a nice grassy area with a river and trees at the end of it and you could not ask for more peace and quiet if you tried. The outdoor bath adds a quirky touch and is a wonderful experience, as is the shower.

As for Stuart, he could not have been more friendly, attentive or lovely. He popped by to check how we were doing a couple of times a day yet gave us plenty of space to get on with our weekend. He is a very interesting person with a great story and it was lovely to get to know him over a few beers on the first evening. Will be coming back here in the summer to experience more the wonderful area has to offer and hopefully see the stars! Thank you for a great weekend, could not recommend more!",5

5470,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Amy,"We saw in the New Year at Stuarts place and we both agreed it was the most unique New Years celebration of our lives. We took the local bus, which dropped us a short walk from Stuarts house. The bus T82 only runs on a Wednesday from Oswestry. One of Stuart‚Äôs friends kindly picked us up and dropped us to his door. Stuart greeted us and showed us around. I think we said the word amazing about 100 times. The photos definitely do not do the place justice. The cabin overlooks a forest and a stream. There is an outdoor bath with views of the hills and the stream and if you get a clear night you can sit in a hot bath under the stars. Not to mention the wood-burning sauna, which is a truly delightful experience. We made full use of the kitchen facilities. If there was anything that we needed there was a shop not too far away. The cabins have heaters, which kept us really warm at all times. There are lots of classic and children‚Äôs VHS for guests to use. Stuart hand built ‚Äúsky pod‚Äù would be perfect for meal times. Next to the sky pod lives Stuart‚Äôs wallabies and his ducks. Stuart was so hospitable, very reliable and an absolute pleasure to get to know and spend time with.

We had a great stay at the cabin. The cabin has all the facilities listed, it was cosy and had everything we needed-it was perfect for us. Lovely walks around the area rivers and lakes. We miss sitting at the cabin having a wine and listening to the owl and the buzzard after a long day hiking. Quite nice being removed from modern day distractions as you get no phone signal.

The cabins are lovely - much nicer than the description. There are actually three - a double, a twin (bunks) and a single (adjacent to the sauna). There's electricity & simple heating, but bring waterproofs & warm stuff if you're coming out of season. They're set in a tranquil private valley with just Stuart's neighbouring house in sight. Great walks in the area, really helped by Stuart lending us a map - thanks, Stuart!

We had a lovely sauna, cooked a couple of great meals in the simple kitchen and enjoyed the outdoor shower.  The ThunderBox loo was cool & quirky. 
If you're the kind of people who are happy to rough it a bit and love something a bit different, then book in here (but leave space for us to return!)...

If I had any negative comments it would be right opposite the cottage is some building works going on. Whilst it didn‚Äôt bother me the first day the second day it did wake me up and there was a lot of smoke from a bonfire on the building site.

5899,Tiny thatched cottage in idyllic village," Huts for Rent in Elsworth, Cambridge, United Kingdom ",Sonia,Stuart,"Sonia and Tim's cottage is in a lovely rural location and being separate from their house you have considerable independence.  As other reviewers have noted the cottage is small but contains all the facilities you require for an overnight stay.  An added advantage of the cottage is the inclusive breakfast that suited our needs; don't expect a full English but cereal, juice, yoghurt and lovely bread.  There are a couple of local pubs but we would recommend the Poachers which served excellent food and had friendly bar staff. We would have no hesitation in returning to the cottage.",5

The hosts were very friendly and the choose your own cold breakfast options (museli, yogurt and a boiled egg for me) were perfectly adequate.
If I'd know there was a microwave in the room, I would have brought some popcorn for the post pub movie watching.

No noise at night. We arrived in a taxi late at night (access easily sorted late), but it would be worth clarifying with Sonia exactly where the property is on the road - it isn't easy to find in the dark with an impatient taxi - eventually we noticed the light on, but a description would be helpful.

We were welcomed by the cheerful Sonia - and introduced to our accommodation which was perched amongst a beautiful rockery filled with bluebells, cowslips and primroses. A beautiful sight on a sunny spring evening. 
The cottage was very clean and had everything we could ever need - despite the small space! We marvelled at the efficient use of space, and the surprising comfort it still provided. Perfectly warm and cosey.
After a walk around the quaint thatched village of Elsworth, we ate locally at The Poacher. The service was friendly and relaxed but efficient, and the food was tasty and just the thing we were after after a long day roaming the Suffolk countryside.
Breakfast from Sonia was presented beautifully and with tasty choices on offer - Sonia hand delivered our breakfast tray to our door first thing the next morning as requested. It was too blissful munching on our muesli and yoghurt, coffee, orange juice and fruit tucked up in bed with the windows wide open listening to the spring morning birdsong. We had planned an early morning departure but ended up staying until check out time!

Sonia welcomed us on arrival, gave recommendations for places to eat and also gave us a sheet to select our breakfast of choice from- a very nice touch! She'd heated the room ready for our arrival too, which was much appreciated, after an afternoon out in the cold. The accommodation is cosy (I would recommend being comfortable in each other's close company if you're planning to stay here with a friend!), presented very nicely and had everything you would expect from regular accommodation (towels, tea, coffee, biscuits, hangers, toilet, shower, wifi, television) for a short stay (and indeed more - microwave also in the room).
We went for food a short walk away at the George and Dragon which had a 2 for 1 deal on so was good value for money. Our main meal was decent (veg a little overdone) and the dessert was great! Sonia told us the other pub in the village (also very close) is starting to serve food again soon too.
We both found the beds to be very comfortable and have a good night's sleep. The provision of breakfast ( bread + accompaniments, cereal, yogurt, fruit juice, and fruit were on offer on this occasion) and we appreciated that Sonia was able to be flexible with the timing of its delivery on the day we visited to allow us a slightly longer lie in (though I understand from the 'order sheet' leaving breakfast with you the night before is also an option when they can't be flexible). All good quality produce and presented nicely too. 
We also enjoyed meeting the two friendly dogs as we returned the keys before leaving!

We had some trouble finding the place but that was mostly because we were having trouble with technology and it was dark and rainy.  Everything was exactly as described -  parking is scarce, the entrance is across a little bridge and there really isn't space in the room to put a suitcase bigger than carry on! The loo, basin and shower have been very cleverly built in. We went to the local for an enjoyable meal & then went straight to bed. It was cosy and comfy :) When we woke we found ourselves in a truly quaint village with thatched cottages and a little brook running along the street.

We used the cottage as a stop off before driving back north, in the past we'd have stayed in a soulless Traveltavern in Cambridge, this is so much better... A beautiful tranquil setting, good facilities in the cottage, REALLY comfortable beds, fantastic breakfast. 
What more can I say other than thanks and next time we fly from Stansted we'll be back.

The cottage is perfect for a weekend getaway and not much luggage. We stayed one night but were travelling for 5 weeks and it was quite awkward with suitcases. It was very clean and tidy and breakfast was very nice. The bed is 2 singles pushed together which was not the best situation. A proper double bed would make more space.

I am not a fan of a hot breakfast so the tray brought to our door was perfect for me . Sonia goes out of her way if there is anything she can get for you. Lovely top end muesli and Deeelish bread , fresh fruit and fruit juice, locally sourced fresh eggs if the hens are laying. 
We also stumbled upon the local pub , The a Poachers , which we would highly recommend. 
If you are looking for small , private accommodation in a ridiculously picturesque Cambridgeshire village , look no further. This place is perfect .

6262,Tiny thatched cottage in idyllic village," Huts for Rent in Elsworth, Cambridge, United Kingdom ",Sonia,Aoife,"I arrived easily with sat nav. I met Sonia in the garden and she showed me around the room. Such an adorable little building! Just as nice as it looks. My only worry when booking was that a little garden hut like that would be cold but I was willing to bear it as it looked so lovely. To my surprise the little heater did a good job and it was very comfortable. The internet worked very well and I was able to do my work effectively. Breakfast was brought to the room at a time that worked for me which was great as I didn't have to leave until a bit later. 

If you are eating locally I can recommend the Poacher. I tried both local pubs and it was definitely the better both in atmosphere and in quality. (The George's food was not great and overpriced in comparison) 

Over all I can highly recommend both the room and the host.  ",5

I must mention the two host dogs who were also lovely hosts, and gave us a welcoming present of a stuffed toy as we arrived!

My rating wasn‚Äôt 5‚≠êÔ∏è because we didn‚Äôt receive any communications for the 18 hours between reservation was made and the time we arrived so we had great difficulty finding the place - using the British postal code for GPS landed us near the Naunton Village Hall. It‚Äôs likely far better to plug in latitude/longitude coordinates into maps OR -advice from the local Inn barkeep - enter the name of the dwelling instead of the address (names are on every doorframe or gate entrance)",4

I did learn from this trip that it would have definitely been more convenient to have purchased international data or a SIM card because there really wasn‚Äôt a way for me to ask Dolly any questions without it.

Some reviews mentioned lack of privacy/not being as secluded as the picture suggests - they aren‚Äôt wrong but I personally never interacted with the family or pets during my stay so it was the distance yet safety I was looking for as a solo traveler.

In my opinion, everything was fantastic, and it's about what you'd expect from a tranquil little farm area, however, if you have any extreme issues with bugs or spiders, this might not be the place for you, as we had to kill a few, yet it didn't really bother us as the inside was mostly spotless. We officially named it Hagrid's Hut. We all really enjoyed the ambiance and location. It is deceivingly large. From the outside you wouldn't think it's as big as it is on the inside. The bathroom actually is connected to the hut, and sits in the back end. There were 3 of us, and we had lots of room. My friend really enjoyed the stars at night, but be prepared for bright sun in the morning, lol. They left us milk and nice little touches to add to our stay. We would be back again, and it's very near some beautiful places in The Cotswolds. I do recommend this, it's much more pleasant than a run of the mill hotel. Thanks again",5

Add to the obvious charm and beauty: the wonderful (and shallow, thank goodness) little pond, the friendly pack of goofy dogs who eat sticks and apples (silly dogs!!) and the free roaming white pony who peeps in the window at you at night and you have an almost otherworldly experience in surreal luxury accommodation. Despite being a deeply rural location, this is actually close to a number of breathtakingly charming towns and attractions, many of which Dolly has kindly listed for guests in a convenient little book.

The hut is very cute and clean with a very cute loft. I was at first worried about sharing parking but we didn't have any issue - the parking is a very short walk to the hut which is located in the garden of her mom's house, there is a little carriage house opposite the hut, but no one was inside so the hut was private when we were there.

I stayed here with a couple friends and our jaws were dropped the entire time. The location in the countryside is idyllic. We loved getting to play with the dogs, and just take in the quiet scenery. I slept up top in the loft, and getting to see the stars while lying in bed was the COOLEST. The small touches were so appreciated, too: the delicious granola and fresh milk for breakfast were perfect. The location is definitely secluded, so prepare for that. We had no wifi, and came in pretty late from our previous place, so finding dinner after 8pm was nearly impossible. As long as you're prepared for true country living, this place is awesome!",5

It was a magical, naturally beautiful setting with great views of the little lily pad pond and fields. The cottage was super clean, with thoughtful touches and great style. As animal lovers, we absolutely loved having the friendly dogs and chickens around. If you are not animal lovers, they would not bother you as the pups were very well mannered and polite. Dolly's mother met us and was very friendly and hospitable, but allowed us lots of privacy. We have travelled to Airbnbs all over the world, and this may be our favorite one yet.

However, the cottage we stayed in was very clean and well-equipped, and Dolly seems to have nice taste in interior decor.

What a treat it was to stay on Dolly's property. The fresh milk was such a treat for tea and breakfast and we were blown away by the thought and care that went into creating such a wonderful space. Doug the dog was a wonderful welcoming party and the sweetest, most well behaved furry friend.  It was difficult to pull my wife away from that divine down comforter and our only regret is that we couldn't spend more time here! Thank you Dolly for making our stay the most memorable part of our UK trip!
I'm glad we brought our camera, and were able to capture a little snippet of our stay. Thank you again.

Dolly‚Äôs cottage provides coffee and microwave which is wonderful. We got our sandwiches heat up and had a cup of hot coffee in the morning.

Personal recommendation: if you are sensitive to sound at sleep, please bring earplugs. Since it‚Äôs surrounded by the nature, the wind and rain may get heavy and loud. I was woken up by the rain couple times but my other friend slept really well and tight.",5

We were greeted by three lovely guineafowl and found our way in to the hideaway with ease. 

The Hideout was clean and warm when we arrived. There was a bit of a bad drain smell but we have messaged Dolly about this directly as I believe it is probably a one off.  We did hear some music late in the evening (Saturday night) but not enough to significantly bother us. It might be with noting that there is no hot water in the sink but we got around this by using hot water from the shower. 

As for value, we felt the property is starting to look a little tired but still represented okay value for the location. This could be helped by updated images on the listing to better reflect changes like the section of the pond that has been filled in and the current condition of the property. 

The weather was miserable and it was blowing a gale outside but the Hideout remained warm and quite through our stay. We would stay again.",4

The bed upstairs not a bed. It‚Äôs two mattresses on top of each other, although looks comfy I decided to not sleep there as there are NO blinds! With windows all around. So if you like to sleep in the dark this may not be for you.
NOT suitable for young children- if they sleep upstairs I‚Äôd be terrified of them falling down the ladder or simply off the mezzanine floor.
Only 2 of the 4 light bulbs worked downstairs, so very poor lighting and only one mirror in bathroom meant getting ready for mine & my sisters night out was interesting.
Shame the path could have been swept (covered in berries & leaves) & dog faeces next to path. 

Positives-
Easy to find. 
Good parking.
Enjoyed the resident animals.",3

The only thing to mention is that we stayed on a Saturday night and in the next field along there are tipis which were hosting a wedding/event and music was playing at full volume until 4am.

On arrival we checked in and I left a voicemail on Dolly's phone but never received a response.
Stained Duvet cover which we didn't notice until we took the throw off the bed and worn bottom sheet.
Greeted by barking dogs albeit lovely and friendly but if you are nervous be aware of this.

- the top windows of the refuge doesn‚Äôt have blinds so if you don‚Äôt mind the sun waking you up, it‚Äôs ok
- there are alot of animal noises all day and night, so you need to be ok sleeping with such noises

6614,Garden refuge in style," Tiny houses for Rent in Naunton, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom ",Dolly,Stephanie,"We came here because the reviews were so good but unfortunately we didn‚Äôt have a positive experience like other guests did, and we feel let down by some of the false details in the listing. 

Firstly, we had issues with the toilet (a leak on the floor to begin with which wasn‚Äôt a big deal but the toilet later made a constant loud trickling noise, and then we had to deal with the plumber in the morning before checking out - few hours of our stay spoilt as a result).

It is a working farm, so do expect noise from animals, etc. However, the host‚Äôs dogs were barking in the early hours of the morning which disrupted our sleep after already having to put up with noise from the toilet. We appreciate that the listing mentions about potential noise, but you don‚Äôt expect to be woken in the early hours when you‚Äôre away on a break that is advertised as ‚Äòcalm and romantic‚Äô.

Unfortunately, after a disturbed evening and sleep, we were then woken at 06:45 by the guineafawl (this usually wouldn‚Äôt bother us, but given the previous disturbances we were fed up by this point). 

The listing states that the host‚Äôs response time is within an hour and that the host has 100% response rate - neither are accurate. We did not always receive a reply within the hour (sometimes several hours late). We also received no prior details about check-in from the host, as we have done with all other Airbnb properties we‚Äôve stayed in, and did not receive a response at all (let alone within an hour) when we enquired about entry to the accommodation before we arrived. Therefore, we felt a bit awkward by just guessing that it was okay to let ourselves in with no specific instructions. We managed to gain entrance okay, but we just found it a bit lazy that there was no effort by the host to send even a generic message in advance about entry. 

Regarding the response rate/time: of course people work/have other commitments which makes replying difficult. We get that. But it‚Äôs not fair to deceive potential guests who are paying a lot of money for a service that is advertised but actually can‚Äôt be offered. Just simply be honest in the listing. Another example is the chauffeur service advertised - we‚Äôve encountered difficulties getting taxis in the Cotswolds before, so thought this was an attractive service on offer. We enquired about it at about 4pm (thinking we‚Äôd get a response within the hour, as advertised) and didn‚Äôt get a response until after 10pm when it was too late. We ended up driving ourselves to the pub and back. Whether this inaccurate listing information is a fault on the host‚Äôs part or Airbnb‚Äôs part, we do not know, but it doesn‚Äôt give us much faith in booking accommodation with Airbnb moving forward. 

We imagine it‚Äôs natural for a lot of people to want to highlight the bad things first when feeling so let down by spending ¬£139 in total for a one-night stay that was far from ‚Äòcalm and romantic‚Äô (in our case). However, it would be unfair not to mention the positives:

The accommodation was clean and tastefully decorated, the land itself was very charming, and Dolly‚Äôs mother was lovely when we spoke to her on a couple of occasions. The dogs barked at us upon arrival but then soon got used to us and were rather friendly, hanging around and sitting outside the accommodation with us. The accommodation is also very well located, with lots of popular places in the Cotswolds only a short drive away. We ate at a local pub called the Hollow Bottom in Guiting Power and had a nice meal. The staff were also lovely there.

On the whole, this place has great potential but we just had an unfortunate experience and (hindsight being a wonderful thing) wish we‚Äôd have stayed elsewhere.",3

We sat in the garden and played with them whilst Jack the horse munched next to us and chickens pecked around us. If you're not so keen on animals, you can just hang out, they wont bother you. 
The tiny house is stylishly decorated to a high spec, with a wet room.  The decor and  bedding are plush. Dolly gives you space but is also really kind and friendly. Her house is nearer than expected but you still have your own idyll. She suggested places to eat and its near to Bourton on the Water, which gets ridiculously busy, even in  the week.

FYI If you're taking public transport, train to Moreton, then bus to Bourton, then walk 3.5 miles... if you're up for it, it's a nice adventure and a beautiful walk! 

Alternatively Excelsior Taxis will pick you up from Kingham station/anywhere near Cheltenham.

If you do plan on doing some walking, bring shoes that you don't mind getting a bit muddy (an oversight on our part)!

The cabin is near the main house where Dolly & her family live, they're lovely for a chat and local tips! I highly recommend going to the Halfway House for dinner - a woman named Tania runs it and the food is fantastic!!

The roaming dogs, chickens, and horses also adds to a great experience :)

We would have liked to engage with them to learn more about the local history, but also to be able to use their kitchen, for example. This may sound like a detail but it is a pity that we were not able to put our milk in the fridge (there is no fridge in the room) nor were we able to wash our dishes after a picnic.

Highlights were the lovely windows in the house (which had light dancing around the walls first thing in the morning and in the evening), the very welcome radiator and the owner's lovely dogs who would appear outside of the door :).  All essentials are provided. We didn't use any of the tea/coffee/breakfast stuff but you would have everything you need here (minus a fridge but Dolly kindly supplies milk sachets) if you decided to have breakfast in, including complementary granola. Dinner at the Halfway House is highly recommended and breakfast at The Hive! As for getting there, Dolly is right - Gmaps/your Satnav will take you to the farm house next door. We arrived at night when it was pitch black and raining and had trouble finding the entrance... if you find yourself in the same boat then I would recommend going up the road a bit further than you think is correct... at which point you should be able to see some horse fencing and just there is where you need to turn. After you've passed this point Dolly's instructions will make perfect sense. We didn't meet Dolly but had the pleasure of meeting her mum who was very friendly. We are the kind of travellers who like to be left to our own devices so really appreciated the privacy we were given. Thanks for the fab stay!",5

We knew this BnB would be fabulous and it was. 
We had a 3 week Europe/UK holiday and this night was a definite highlight. 
Dolly and Barbara were so welcoming, and the dogs and chooks were an added bonus. There were also some week old kittens to fawn over.
After a busy few days in London, getting out to the country was just delightful. We could just have easily have booked accomodation in one of the villages, but really... why not experience the country properly.
The accomodation was absolutely spotless. By far the cleanest of our entire trip. 
The duvets and pillows were like heaven. Our (adult) daughter slept upstairs in the loft and she said it was like sleeping in a marshmallow. (She also said she wanted to pick up the building and take it home with her.)  
The decor was great, the bathroom just beautiful. 
Lots of supplies in the way of tea/coffee/milk and cereals. We happened to have some strawberries and raspberries with us, so elected for breakfast in the garden rather than going to town for a cooked meal. 
Plenty of privacy.

A bit of retail therapy led us to this truly unique, and most picturesque of settings. Glorious sunshine and endless countryside surrounded the Duck House during our stay. We really couldn't have had it any better. The weather and the scenery were only enhanced by the dogs who live on site, who joined us as we sat outside having a cup of tea.
The building itself is open, bright and warm. The bathroom is a work of art, and the general decor is homely and cosy.
I can't give the Dolly (and her mum) any less than a 10/10!

We enjoyed a lovely night and woke up in the morning to the sound of birdsong in the middle of a a stunning country garden. A very comfortable bed, a homely feel that is also very stylish. Even though it's small there is everything you need to hand with nice touches like having breakfast cereal and a nice selection of soaps and shampoos. 
Dolly herself made was extremely kind and patient especially given that we phoned for directions at 3 in the morning having stumbled in from a party. My only criticism is that it's very difficult to find if you don't have a sat-nav that allows you to enter co-ordinates. Post code alone won't get you there. There could find no phone signal so spent nearly 90 minutes trying to find the place as we didn't want to phone and disturb so late at night. A couple of signs not least at the entrance to the track leading to the property would have helped so much! ",4

Our host Dolly could not have been more accommodating. She kindly welcomed us into her home despite having dealt with a big storm and huge cleanup that day. 
We had a nice dinner at a local pub within walking distance and a very good breakfast at the old post office as suggested by Dolly.

I was able to wash my clothes there and he even went so far as to dry them and fold them for me while I was out exploring. (I'm not guaranteeing he will do the same for everyone. Sorry Mike if all your guests expect you to do their laundry now. Haha.) 

As far as location, I can't imagine a better place to stay. Right in the middle of Central London. You'll be at his doorstep within 7 minutes of stepping off the train at Kings Cross. There are so many food options close by. And even more within a 15 minutes walk. I had a great breakfast and coffee 5 minutes away at The House of Morocco. And that evening got a Thai massage at Taitum-D right next door. Now that's how you vacation. And if you're from the States like me and are craving a good old american hamburger there's even a 5 Guys Burgers right by Kings Cross. 

I love walking a city when I visit and this location was perfect for that. Walking you really get a feel for a place. And you get to see and hear all the different people from all over the world. I love it. I walked 45 minutes to see Big Ben (Under Renovation). Another short walk and saw Buckingham Palace. Then took the tube up to Camden. What a wonderful place for shopping and eating. Highly recommended. I could've walked back from there as it would have only been about 30 minutes but I didn't want to be late for my massage so I took the tube back to Kings Cross. Honestly, I couldn't imagine a better place to locate yourself to take in many of London's biggest sites.

His place is spick and span. He has generously provided shampoo, body wash, and anything else you might need (hair dryer, although I'm bald, and a mini fridge if needed).

There are many fantastic things about Mike‚Äôs place, but if I had to narrow it down, the best features would be location, safety and comfort.

Location:
When I began seeking accommodations for my trip, I wanted something centrally located for easily and closely accessing all the sights I wanted to see. Mike‚Äôs description for his listing caught my attention for that reason; he was so correct about it being an ideal location for public transit in central London! It is about a 5 minute walk to Kings Cross-St Pancras tube and overground rail stations. It also has 2 bus stops very close by, one stop right outside the door of the flat and one just around the corner on Euston Road (which will be the main road you can walk up and down from the tube/train stations). You could also walk to many places. I walked to St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral from the flat one day, which was another good perspective for seeing things. My preference to get to my desired attractions became the bus.

In addition to the close proximity to all the public transit options, there are sooooooooo many amenities close by - coffee shops, restaurants, pubs and bars, shopping, banks...you name it, it was close by!

Safety:
This listing is in a very safe area and had many features that increase safety coming and going from the flat. This was highly important to me as a solo female traveller. Upon check in, Mike gave me my own key fob and set of keys for opening the security door and flat door respectively. He then walked me through how to get in and out of the building and flat. He also kept the door locked at all times. The street and entrance were very well lit. Kings Cross seemed to also be alive and bustling with people at any hour of the day or night, so I never felt nervous walking alone.

Comfort:
At check-in, Mike said to me that this was my home for the week. It sure was home for my week there! :) It was tastefully decorated, with a welcoming comfy bed, and all the little touches of things you might need. The most practical and thoughtful touches were  a great universal travel adapter sort of power bar to operate appliances and charge devices all at once, a kettle and an assortment of tea, as well as a heated towel bar that warms up your towel while in the shower. He also has a washing machine and a drying rack which I took advantage of (I checked ahead because I wanted to travel light - being able to do laundry allowed me to do so!)

At last, Mike‚Äôs warmth and hospitality augmented the stay. He is funny, helpful and full of knowledge about local life. We also had many chats about gardening (I am a novice, while he is a seasoned professional horticulturalist) - I even learned a few tips and we went to Kew Gardens, an amazing botanic garden where he did his training. üòä

Mike is an exceptional host and the flat is a true home away from home! I would definitely stay again on future visits to London, and I would highly recommend anyone to take advantage of this listing - it‚Äôs awesome!",5

The location is super. I've been to London many times but it was best location so far. Many places are within walking distance and bus station which links to Notting Hill, Trafalga square and Covent Garden etc. is in front of his flat.

About 5 min to King's Cross and about 8-10min to St. Pancras to me and I don't walk that fast ^^;  My eurostar departure time was around 12:30pm and I still could take warm shower in the morning, have a breakfast and go to Oxford Circus and Liberty for my last minute shopping without heavy luggages.

Stuart then offered to book us a table at a local restaurant by the lake and offered us a lift to and from because of the weather. On top of all that, the cabins were really fantastic, such a unique experience and so much fun. A place that really allows you to enjoy some time alone in a very off the grid manner! Loved every minute of it and if it wasn‚Äôt good enough, Stuart made myself and my partner a fire outside the cabin, shortly after collecting us from the local restaurant!

Upon arrival I loved the charm of the back-to-basics cabins but arrived to find Stuart had warmed up the cabin with a heater so was immediately very cosy! This is not a boutique glamping experience and still feels very wild which is exactly what I was looking for.  I loved the nostalgia of the enormous VCR collection and enjoyed a couple of films before turning in. My only minor complaint is that the bedsheets were a bit musty. It may well be I was the first guest of the year and the cold weather prior had affected the state of the bedding. The shower had dead leaves in it but Stuart kindly supplied a rake (!). A really quirky stay here that I hope to repeat in warmer months. The access to the nearby Lake Vyrnwy was so convenient and I had a great time. Thank you, Stuart.

Great communication but no phone internet on the way means- check his worded description so you won‚Äôt get lost. Super quirky and fun. If you like glam ping, cabin life and having a different kind of experience- I loved it. The sunken outdoor bathtubs are blissful, open view bathroom is not for everyone but totally my cup of tea.

The cabins are as pictured and so much fun to explore, we took great delight in picking a video each night and even made use of the ‚Äúhalf outdoor‚Äù bathroom for one of the most peaceful baths I‚Äôve ever had, as well as the outdoor shower. The area is quiet and if the sky is clear there is an excellent view of the stars as you sit around the firepit in the evening. As we stayed in October there were many leaves and spiders about however this didn‚Äôt bother us, and there are brooms to sweep leaves away if needed. I highly recommend Stuart‚Äôs cabins for a back to basics stay, you can tell that they have all been built with love to be enjoyed by all, and they really do capture the spirit of Juhannus, even on a wet and windy day!",4

The cabins are warm (when the heaters are on) and the beds comfortable. 
The place could do with a bit of a clean and perhaps better signage as even with Stuarts directions, we found it tricky to locate.

7993,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Hannah,"What a place! Magical. Stuart is such a welcoming, grounded down to earth person. Very accommodating yet leaves you to it as well. The character of the place is beautiful and it really speaks for itself. The wifi is a bonus, plates, cups, utensils are all provided as well as toilet paper and towels and bedding. It‚Äôs a great value for your money and if I‚Äôm honest, one night just simply isn‚Äôt enough. In the winter I would suggest taking some warm clothes; although there is heaters in the room as well as a huge choice of DVD‚Äôs, Games and more. Makes you realise how something of imagination can make you feel so at home. Would definitely reccomend. I had a significant amount of questions of where my stay was due to me posting on social media. Like I say, it speaks for itself.
Thank you again Stuart, your hospitality was just right. I hope you enjoy this journey that we all call life.

7997,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sophia,"What a magical destination. Took my boyfriend for his birthday surprise and it lived up to every expectation and more. Stuart is just so accommodating and did everything he could to make sure we had the most enjoyable time. He invited us in for a whisky and organised for us to visit the local piglet farm. We arranged before-hand for some friends to come down for the second night which Stuart made so easy and helped me arrange at just a small extra cost per person. The place itself is welcoming, cosy and just simply magical. We loved the VHS tapes and supply of games for the evenings and took full advantage of the natural beauty of Lake Vyrnwy with a bike ride & lunch by the water during the day. However, back at the Air BnB, the outdoor baths under the stars were my favourite part - a real-life movie scene. If you‚Äôre looking for a break away somewhere peaceful and unique, that is great value for money, then this is your lucky find!!! Romantic and heaps of fun, it‚Äôs got something for everyone.

We found this the most tranquil location, the river and reservoir walks are within easy reach.  This is definitely on the glamping side of camping , with a Finnish cabin feel and sauna was  a great addition , the accomodation was perfect for our needs but we are fairly easy to please. Simple accomodation but well arranged, clean fresh beds and towels provided, and if going in winter you will definitely will need to wrap up as mid September  was starting to chill. As a couple we felt it was private, and group could stay here but check the bed arrangements in advance with Stuart , there is some simple electric wall  heaters in the rooms to take the edge off as single skin cabins.  However nothing can compare to the amazing  hot baths under the shooting stars,  rainbows üåà were all on que and quite magical and we would definitely come back again very soon!",5

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs between camping and glamping, kind of rustic glamping. It isn‚Äôt posh, but quirky, wild, weird and FUN! The setting was glorious, quiet, fresh air and peaceful.
Warm cabins, fresh bedding which was a must for us. Rustic kitchen but plenty of cooking utensils, literally everything you needed it had! 
WiFi was good! TVs and VHS/DVDs everywhere, even you tube and Netflix, certainly came in handy when the kids wanted to slob out for half hour. 
Two hot baths outside overlooking the trees and river, super hot water! Then the loo with a view and extra bath was lovely with fairy lights on the ceiling. 
We had a great time :) thank you",5

Stuart is a very welcoming host and saved us when our car broke down upon leaving. Quirky, fun and fabulous stay. Google maps shows the correct location (also using Stuart's clear instructions).

Lovely area for sitting out and socialising or just listening to the birdsong and getting acquainted with a friendly robin.

Stuart was warm and welcoming and we got there a little too early and even the lady who was getting the place ready and clean was lovely and friendly . 
This place is just perfect , it has everything you could need . We have a large family so for us it was amazing to find somewhere with room for us all but that still gave us our own space . 
The rooms are just lovely and you can all sit out at night and it‚Äôs just so peaceful ! Even though Stuart‚Äôs house is down at the end of the lane you honestly feel like you are miles from anyone it‚Äôs very private .  Stuart is on hand to help with anything you need and really friendly and helpful he even brought us some water balloons for the kids to have a water fight and had a beer with us , but he doesn‚Äôt intrude either and  gives you your privacy . 
For us we loved that there are old vhs cassettes in the rooms and even though there is wifi, which we aren‚Äôt expecting we‚Äôd be happier without it , it all adds to the whole experience of getting away from everything , we played board games until late and the kids had so much fun in the outdoor baths with their costumes on . Much better than sitting ignoring each other in mobile phones ! There are lots of quirky little things around the place which we all loved , and it has its own character which makes it really cute . 
Stuart really has thought of everything , it still has a camping feel to it which I love but it‚Äôs got everything , there‚Äôs even a separate outside bath where you can see the stars and have a glass of wine and relax . 
We were really sad to leave and we will definitely be back , the girls said it was their favourite holiday ever and want to come back . 
Thank you Stuart for such an amazing stay and for being such a lovely host . I hope this place stays the same because it‚Äôs perfect üòä",5

This is my 3rd visit and each time there is something new about the place.  Stuart clearly works hard to maintain this place and listens to feedback.

Check out the waterfalls at lake vyrnwy ü§©‚ù§Ô∏è. 
Stuart is a great host.  Met us on arrival and left us to it as we had been before.  Came to check that evening if we had everything and joined us for a Beer.

8022,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sue,"You‚Äôve seen it. It‚Äôs fabulous. There are cobwebs and leaves and the odd dead moth here and there. Shabby chic is at its finest here. You book your holiday knowing this. If you think it‚Äôs anything else then you are deluded. 
If you want peace and quiet..and a little bit of magic then get on and book it. It‚Äôs magical. I‚Äôve been to the loo in the room with three walls, and it‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶. But I can‚Äôt explain why. There is a steep set of steps to get down to that particular loo but it is so worth the climb. There is another toilet but you are wasting opportunities if you don‚Äôt pay a call in, what can only be described as ‚Äòa call to the wild‚Äô.  There is the river and the forest... and there is nobody around to see you. 
It‚Äôs ridiculously basic ‚Ä¶but there is everything you need. The Husband is cooking steaks on the washing machine drum and I‚Äôve precooked the spud in the microwave which has now been added to his bbq.  
If it‚Äôs raining it‚Äôs no problem, you can be under cover on the veranda. There is another bath in the three walled bathroom so You may end up there for your twilight bath. It‚Äôs no problem, it‚Äôs still the same spectacular view. 
You could get ten people sleeping here, I reckon. It‚Äôs not for toddlers; there is a very steep slope, but if your kids are reasonably well behaved and you can trust them not to perform death defying stunts down the hill, then this place is for you. There is a double bed in one cabin, bunk beds in another and the treehouse sleeps two/three (there is a mattress on the floor- fine for a little one) There is also a sitting room with a futon in it .. another couple of bodies could crash on there. I didn‚Äôt use the Swedish sauna.  It‚Äôs not my kind of thing. But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just as good as the rest of the facilities. Honestly, a group of adults and kids on here would have a totally brilliant experience. A few bottles of wine and some good grub and you are well and truly sorted. 
You get this place to yourselves. There are no other visitors.  If there are a few of you out there with a couple of kids, some of you with extended family; this place is perfect for you. Remember the steep slope ‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶. Seriously‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs awesome !",5

Had a really great nights sleep and kept nice and cosy. We were impressed with the electric and water facilities. There were spare plug sockets for phone chargers and the water was toasty and warm! Kitchen is suitably stocked for basic cooking. it's a great location close to tourist spots. Stuart was nice and welcoming and there if needed but left us to it!!,5

Don't expect 5* accommodation and you will not be disappointed. The place is beautiful and has everything you need. Could be cleaner, but, again, don't expect it and you'll be fine. We loved our stay and would definitely return. We have already made recommendations. There are loads of videos, tonnes of hot water, lots of places to sit and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. No passing traffic, just the odd robin and pheasant! Stuart was very welcoming, set us up with WiFi and soon had a fire going for us for a bit of warmth outside (May) and then to cook our sausages! The bedrooms were toasty warm each with an electric heater.",4
8038,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Laura,"This is the absolute best place for a night away/weekend where you just want to switch off from everything. Stuart was helpful and kind and suggested a walk around the local lake, which was breathtaking. We then paid Stuart a little extra to light us a fire and cooked burgers from the local shop. The outdoor baths are awesome and if you‚Äôre lucky to have a starry night then they‚Äôre simply magical.",5
8039,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Frances,"I stayed here for one night while walking Glyndwr's way. The huts are ideally located, just off the route. 
I'd read the reviews so I knew what to expect but the huts exceeded my expectations! It is just so peaceful with only the sound of birds and the river to keep you company.
You have the option to escape it all and switch off or you can take advantage of the wifi and netflix.
I enjoyed an outside bath which was very relaxing!
Stuart is nearby if needed but he left me to it throughout my stay.",5

Fantastic spot, you‚Äôre not overlooked by anything with the sound of the forest and a stream below as the only background noise! The rooms are well equipped with TVs, DVDs, VHSs and even Wifi! There‚Äôs heaters and adequate bedding. The outdoor baths are an amazing experience, as someone else has said, and equally as beautiful for a morning dip with birdsong as they are under the stars. The kitchen has everything you need to whip up a nice meal. We didn‚Äôt ask about the sauna as there was that much we actually forgot! Can‚Äôt wait to return, no wonder it‚Äôs always booked.

This is the most heavenly of retreats.  Being so built into nature with the outdoor bathtubs and shower it was tranquil and peaceful.  We loved the outdoor baths, sitting in them listening to the birds sing & the stream below.  Candlelit too made this a very special nature experience.  Outdoor fire & a sauna t‚Äôboot!! Quirky and inspiring.  We loved everything about Stuarts bnb experience.  If it had more stars ‚≠êÔ∏è we would give it more.  We highly recommend this experience to anyone.

Rustic; back to nature, glamping type experience.  Cabins/bathroom/toilet/kitchen lovely and clean. Of course outdoor stuff is not so clean but I think that is more to do with being weathered and needing a couple of replacements more than anything else. Stuart a good communicator; close enough if you need anything; far away enough for privacy. Great value stay with no distractions ; even my son and his girlfriend (aged 20 and 21) enjoyed being switched off from everyday city life where everything is immediately accessible and consists of various screens that can zombify you.

Set in a lovely location, private, quirky and ideal for the price. Stuart the host was great and attentive, we had the fire lit in the evening and we used the bath also. The weather was around -2 in the night and we woke up to frost outside but the room was lovely and warm. Close by to Lake Vyrnwy and near by is a short walk to the waterfall, the north side of the lake.

Stuart is a welcoming and genuinely kind host and full of helpful information about the local area . Totally went above and beyond as a host and invited us in his home for a welcome drink & use of wifi (got to meet his cat Hamish too!). We had an amazing time using the outdoor bath, stargazing, watching videos from the vast selection (so much nostalgia!). We were warm in the cabins & comfy beds & duvets and wish we‚Äôd booked longer and will 100% be returning. Not difficult to find when following the clear directions on the listing, we absolutely loved the Halloween decs as well that greeted us. Great location and loved the cabins - any complaints regarding this listing (although there‚Äôs few) are clearly from people who‚Äôve never camped before so don‚Äôt know what they expected outdoor cabins. Plenty of facilities for heating food and plenty of hot water between the 4 of us. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and can‚Äôt praise Stuart enough.",5

8066,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Caroline,"Due to horrendous weather conditions, our stay was very cold wet and damp. We left early as we couldn‚Äôt take it any more. There was inadequate heating in the tree house and none in the sky pod which limited space for our family of 8. What was supposed to be a happy 50th birthday celebration turned out to be a disaster. Ideal in summer when weather is better but not in winter. We were limited for cooking as there is no oven. Nowhere to sit and eat together as the benches are outside. No locks on doors which made us feel vulnerable when going out and about for security. On the plus side, the bath with a view was nice and Stuart, the host cannot do enough for you. The heating issues need sorting if you are visiting during the winter months. Wi-Fi is provided. Make sure you ask otherwise you wont get it.",2

8069,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sasha,"This is a hard review to write because we loved our trip and definitely made the most of the place but it has lots of things that need to be mentioned to future prospective guests.

Firstly, our visit was in January, so of course it was freezing, but there‚Äôs only heating in the bedroom (which is good heating from a small machine and very welcome). So the kitchen is cold, the bathroom is cold, and the top of the skypod was completely unusable due to the cold and lack of heating. We didn‚Äôt use the bunk bed room or the treehouse room.

Secondly, the cleanliness is practically non-existent. There are webs and dirt everywhere. The fridge hadn‚Äôt been cleaned and absolutely reeked so we just kept our food outside. We had to rewash the dishes before using them and the dishcloths were dirty.

Thirdly, the huts and outside bath are more in view of Stuart‚Äôs property than we were lead to believe. However with our car parked in between we got a little more privacy.

Both baths are completely open which was our favourite part of the place. The stargazing is incredible and the hot water is very good and stayed hot.

The sauna was good. We paid for the wood which we helped Stuart get out ourselves.

The location is great for access to loads of incredible sites and waterfalls, only a short drive away. There‚Äôs only one shop in the area which is a petrol station, a takeaway and a small grocery. There‚Äôs absolutely no service around the area and no Wifi at the property (which was listed so we knew what we were in for) - great for escapism but tricky at times.

A couple really strange things I have to note are the weird halloween decorations in January, the duck chained to the bath was very odd, a severed hand and warning signs all down the entrance path (???), and oddest of all was a review of the place framed in the bathroom that was the world‚Äôs worst review so comical I had to take a photo in disbelief. It‚Äôs the only review displayed in the place and an A4 side explaining how much they hated the place. Very very confusing.

Despite all this we did have a good trip with lots of memories after we got used to the oddities of the huts.",3
8070,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Tiago,"What a fantastic little place! My wife and I celebrated our anniversary with a weekend away in Wales, staying at Stuart‚Äôs cabins. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay at and we are already planning our next visit.

When we arrived, Stuart invited us in for a drink and found out all sorts of interesting things about him! Very welcoming and warm host.

The cabins, as most people have stated in their reviews, are basic but warm. The kitchen has a microwave, hob, kettle.
We used the sauna on our last evening and it was a really nice way to relax and defrost after a cold day out.

The highlight of the trip: the outdoor bath!
The first evening we got there all the pipes were frozen so we were quite skeptical about it all, but as the sun rose the pipes thawed and we were able to try it out.
DIVINE. The water was so warm (it can get quite scalding actually!) and you could just lie there listening to the birds and the river. We loved it and already miss it.",5

Don‚Äôt expect luxury. If that‚Äôs what u want look elsewhere but for a back to nature break and a chance to unwind and be tech free then give it a go. 
The heaters in the rooms are enough, the water in the outdoor shower/bath is hot and there is a small kitchen (no oven) that does the job! The supply of Old Skool VHS is brilliant! Nostalgia at its best!

We came here in October and the cabins were so warm on arrival and all while we was there, wish we took an electric blanket for when we got into bed, 
The shower and bath was amazing with red hot boiling water so be careful, the cabins were all clean and tidy, we took our own quilts and pillows so extra comfy, the fire we kept going all night and even cooked on the fire, 

The kitchen is perfect, yes the pots are used and may not be up to everyone‚Äôs standards but clean them and use foil what‚Äôs the problem üôÇ, cooker was perfect to make tea and breakfast everyday while we was there and at night we used the fire to cook, 

Stuart met us on arrival and was super easy going doing his own thing, all the little things around the cabins are amazing you find new things every minute, 

Just an hour away from Barmouth bay which I would recommend to anyone that‚Äôs staying but please leave to come back while it‚Äôs light because the roads are dangerous around llandywnn, 

Stuart your cabins are amazing and the story behind them are interesting, it was nice talking to you and spending time at your air bnb, thank you again and see you soon,

8091,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Steven,"This place was perfect for a real nice quick get away. Just tucked away town a country lane in a beautiful part over the county.
Stuart gave me a warm welcome and offered a beer after a long drive. Fire wood was offered for ¬£7 which kept me going all night. 
This place was great for me and my dog to escape form London and get away form everyone . I think this can cater for 1 - 10 people? The cabins are old school and rustic and all look made by hand as  a hobby. But are completely suitable for purpose, if was a cold evening but the cabin was kept nice and warm.
You have a 2/3 cabins to relax and enjoy the scenery in with a selection of sofa beds, armchairs and classic dvds and video tapes available. 
The kitchen was only small but done the job, it is fully furnished with cooking equipment and a fridge that I filled with beer.
I only used the the microwave and used the open fire outside to cook my dinner on.
The outside shower, and start gazing baths were interesting to say the least. I loved the idea of them but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. 
I only stayed one night but would of been more than happy to stay more if I had the chance. This is more of a ‚Äúglamping‚Äù establishment and was exactly what I was after. You could ask for bay more for you money at all. I stayed in a travel lodge the next night which I feel was a step down üòÇ
I would recommend *****",5
8092,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,A,"Pros:
1. Warm and welcoming host.
2. Excellent location, although you must read host's instructions to reach the place.
Perfect for walking trips. Beautiful lake and waterfall trek nearby. 
3. Lots of quirks and special additions, eg. Massive range of movies, Treehouse, sauna, 2x open bath tubs, instant hot running water, basic amenities, secluded enough, running river close by. 

Cons:
1. The place lacked a basic level of cleanliness. The remainder of people's meals in the microwave, grease around the stove, filty hand basins, unswept patios. That said, the toilet bowls were clean and the rooms were tidy.
2. The place comes up as ¬£35/night on Airbnb, which is a little misleading, because as soon as you add an adult it goes up by ¬£20/night and then there's another ¬£10 Airbnb charge.
3. There was a mention of a Sauna, but no mention of extra cost for wood, except for in the reviews. Reviews said ¬£5 extra for wood. We were charged ¬£7 extra 'due to wood prices going up'.",4

I can imagine the tree house may be a bit cooler though in October.  The quirky decor is fun. There is a huge choice of VHS video films and dvds to watch on the TV‚Äôs come late evening but daytime it‚Äôs just gorgeous to take in the wild outdoor wilderness that surrounds you.  The sound of the flowing river below, the birds, trees and nature.  Fill the bath just before Dawn with piping hot water and lie and wait for the Dawn chorus and watch the sun rise. Or at night gaze at the stars.. Priceless!!  Obviously it‚Äôs a bit grubby, dusty, covered in cobwebs, mini beasts etc but it‚Äôs bound to be.. that‚Äôs the whole point!! pink fluffy fussy folk may sadly not appreciate it!! We loved it!!  Very little phone signal and internet (which actually adds to the relaxation). Stuart is the perfect host.. very helpful and friendly.. we shared a drink at his gorgeous home which is next door but far away enough from the huts for privacy.  A visit to the nearby huge gorgeous lake is a must. We can highly recommend Stuart‚Äôs place. Great value for money too.",5
8094,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Ian,Great stay at Stuart‚Äôs place. Really friendly welcome from Stuart and even had a bad experience with guests the previous night but still very welcoming and we shared a drink. Fantastic location and super quiet. Quirky and unusual accommodation just as described. Only there for one night and didn‚Äôt use sauna and bath but they were there if I had wanted too. Loads of videos and treated myself to Point Break! Will stay again when in the area. Thanks,5

8096,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Jordan,"I had a nice stay here with my friends after hiking snowdon on the weekend. It was pretty well equipped with cooking and bbq utensils, lots of old tvs and huge movie selection, and few board games. You could buy a large bucket of wood for a ¬£5 which would last you a night, and he offered to rent us some of his bikes if that's what you're into. Didn't have any signal on vodaphone but EE seemed to have some service. There was heaters in the bedrooms although the construction of the cabins weren't insulated. The tree house bedroom was too cold for us to sleep in October. Clean towels and linen so no complaints there.  The tree house was was quite close to the owners house and the entire airbnb area wasnt very secluded so might not be the best choice for a romantic holiday. I stayed with a few mates so we didn't have an issue with that. The outside bath was in complete view through the window of his house so I wouldn't want to be in the nude! We really enjoyed the bathtub and toilet overlooking the forest though. It would have been nice if there was some hedge or a fence to give the place a bit more privacy, I've found this the case with allot of airbnb cabins I've stayed in that they are not very secluded from the owner's house. The suana room was locked and wasn't mentioned upon arrival. I remembered there was supposed to be a suana on the second day and Stuart explained that he had some guests previously that made a mess with essential oils or something so if you want to use the suana you need to ask Stuart to come down to unlock the room, light the fire and explain how to use the suana properly. Bit of a shame as I would have preferred to have been explained and have access to the suana upon arrival. It would be nice to have a suana at 12 o'clock at night without having to go through the entire process. You might want to bring your own drinking water as the tap water he said wasn't for drinking. There was drinking water provided in a large plastic container which tasted clean to me but not sure of its source and how long its been sitting there, sure its fine though. Enjoyed the stars and fire pit at night, and the fairy lights and candles were a nice touch. Good value and a nice  alternative to camping. Thanks for having us.",3
8097,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Asma,"Absolutely fantastic location very close to lake vyrnwy, the sat nwb location takes you very near the vicinity but you would need assistance after that.
Stuart was very helpful, stay easy comfortable with quirky facilities, if your looking for something different and love nature it ticks the boxes.",5
8098,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Diane,"Ok true reflection of our 3 day break. From the very start Stuart was welcoming, friendly and very happy to share his home with us. Is this for the faint hearted‚Ä¶ no, but everything was accurate as per the listing. This is a true back to nature experience ( but with little extras) where else can you stay in a treehouse that has running hot water, usb plugs, and kitchen utilities such as fridge and microwave. From immediate arrival we completely switched off, having little phone signal and internet makes it even more relaxing. Sitting under the stars, hearing the river flow below was just what was needed. Are there cobwebs and spiders YES but what do you expect!! Stuart has made the place very special and unique, everyday you noticed something else quirky around the site. Ideal place to escape and go back to basics. Attempted to watch the numerous videos available but to be honest so much fresh air just made us fall fast asleep soon as our head hit the pillows. Stuart thank you for being so welcoming helping us out when needed and giving us privacy was really appreciated. Look forward to seeing you again soon.",5

Honestly our stay couldn't of been better. We were able to invite extra friends for one night and it was so perfect. Sauna was beautiful and omg the scenery! Very peaceful location. Had a wonderful few nights here! Very warm and toasty. AND best shower of my life, I would come back just for the shower.",5
8101,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sadie,"This was a fantastic spot for a weekend getaway but really wished we could have stayed longer! The cabins are set at the top edge of a valley between bracken and trees and just a five minute drive from Lake Vyrnwy, where you can rent canoes, kayaks, SUPs, etc. 
Stuart was a great host, and even came to light a fire for us in the evening (well worth the extra ¬£5!). The rooms were well equipped with radiators, bedding and even TVs and VHS! 
Our favourite part about the accommodation was definitely the outdoor bath in the morning, accompanied by the sound of the river flowing in the valley and the birds in the surrounding trees and greenery.",5
8102,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Celia,"Stuart has an amazing, established setting for anyone who loves life.

We will definitely visit again. Celia, Bigman, Raff (who appreciated your building ability) and Fran (who will look after us all should she govern!)",5
8103,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Natalie,"If you're looking for a quirky, rustic, cabin in the woods (or should I say several cabins all to yourselves) complete with out door bath and sauna this is the place for you. You'll be sharing the site with a three legged cat called Hamish, numerous rubber ducks and the odd spider. The setting is gorgeous, you can go visit the lake down the road (complete with impressive dam and sculptures) and have all sorts of adventures if you use it as a base to go white water rafting or to the various zip world centres as we did. Stuart always arrived at just  the right moment to light the fire or get the sauna going  (just let him know when you want it) and then he will go off and leave you to enjoy the place.",5
8104,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Ian,"Just spent two nights at Stuart‚Äôs cabins and have had a tremendous time! So relaxing the setting is superb the views stunning the first night there we had clear skies and the most spectacular star views it is hard to put into words especially when in the outdoor bath with a drink and taking it all in,really beautiful! My wife and I likened the cabins to and American hunting cabin you see on tv is it this a five star hotel definitely not but it‚Äôs rustic and quirky as hell and yeah there are cobwebs etc but hey your in the middle of open country so there are bugs etc but we grew up camping so was not an issue for us but don‚Äôt expect the ritz lol. The sauna was great too wood burning and does get hot!. The outdoor bath is great to take in the scenery especially when it‚Äôs pitch black on the nights. The bedding was freshly laundered and very clean and Stuart is a helpful and very pleasant host his house is nearby and as we had zero phone reception is reassuring in case of any emergency! Candles are provided and great atmosphere enhancers for the nights all the cabins have electricity and dvd and video table players and tv‚Äôs with massive collection of film to watch from kids films through to horrors so all good there! There is a caravan style twin burner and microwave for cooking with cutlery pots and pans etc  Lake vrynwy is a mile away and definitely worth visiting it‚Äôs beautiful and at the artisans cafe there is WiFi so can check in on home if you want too, latte is lovely too. In summing up if you if you can appreciate a more rustic break in beautiful surrounding and just want to relax from the busy world you will love it if you you need a little more luxury then it‚Äôs probably not for you but we loved it!",5
8105,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Hannah,"I had a brilliant time at Stuarts! Its such a cool place, ive never seen anything like it! He's totally done his own thing and its so much fun to see. I lucked out having the whole place to myself on a beautifully hot day so the best experience ever! Enjoyed the nature bath which feels like total luxury and the stars at night were epic! 100% staying again, for longer! Thank you Stuart! Brilliant place you've made üëè",5
8106,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Gail,"Did a last minute booking and it was great value for money given we had the entire space to ourselves. We visit the Lake every season and stay somewhere different and local every time, Stuart's is very local indeed accessed down a tarmac road then down a track, not overly steep and more than doable in a car. Instructions to it are very clear and easy to find.

We stayed in the double room net to the 'Thunder Box' and near the outdoor seating, this room had a little balcony and a kitchen next door which was adequate for us as we generally eat out anyway. Had a indoor/outdoor shower which has the facing wall removed so you have uninterrupted views of the trees below and you can hear the River as you bathe, loved the fact its river water heated up and don't be put off bu the colour, felt very refreshed and clean when got out. 

We were going to use the sauna but never got round to it. Stuart kindly lit the fire for us with his slow torch saving me building and getting the fire going as was lit and well underway within minutes, we took kindling and wood as we were not sure if there would be wood available. Stuart has lots of tea lights for use too. 

As we are of a certain age, it was fun listening to the hiss ion a VHS video again and seeing classic films from our youth, nice retro feel. Sockets by the bed have a USB charger outlet included so can charge phones albeit you have to get above higher ground to get a signal but that is notoriously difficult in the area generally, you can pop to Artisan's cafe and use their free wi-fi. Make sure you take your essentials with you tea/coffee/milk and the local shop shuts early so its not a quick trip for milk. Maybe Stuart could include a point in the fridge to get a brew incase you forget.

If you expect a hotel style sanitised environment then this is not for you, no matter how clean in such a natural surroundings you are going to get spider webs etc, to expect not too is unrealistic. The room was clean, smelt fresh, bedding was clean, bed was fine, kitchen was clean and easy to use, had to wash out the bath and would expect to given one is outside in the elements and the other has 3 walls, but this is not an issue as I said its located in natural surroundings. This is a great place for children too as space for games and critter spotting. The black skies are amazing and as we had aa clear night fab views of stars. It felt remote although it really isn't the village is a mile away, it felt ""off the grid"" and this added to ensuring a relaxed ""leave it all behind you"" stay. We loved our brief stay and especially Hamish the 3 legged girl cat who is adorable and friendly and a huntress as she sat guarding our room and keeping an eye out for critters. You have nothing to lose by trying something different and a lot to gain by going with the flow and chilling out.",5
8107,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Andy,"As mentioned in other reviews, this is a step up from camping so if you enjoy the outdoors, this is the place for you.  

The location is beautiful and very peaceful with access to a secluded stretch of river.  The outdoor shower and baths have loads of hot water and it really is an experience to have a shower outdoors.

For ¬£10 extra, Stuart provided wood for our fire and also for the sauna, both of which, he will light for you if needed.

We enjoyed having no phone signal or WiFi for the weekend and our teenage girls really enjoyed the novelty of watching films on VHS.

There is a small shop in the local village which does takeaway food including pizza and also stocks a selection of meat if you fancy a bbq. 

Stuart was a great host, friendly and there when we needed him but happy to leave us  to our own devices. 

We had a brilliant time and would definitely return.",5
8108,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rebecca,"Stuart‚Äôs place is great if you‚Äôre looking for something different and have young children. We‚Äôve got four children aged between four and eight and they had a great time (we realised how it was happening and have made sure there are no more on the way). It would be easy to miss the place if you didn‚Äôt have good directions as it is down a narrow and bumpy track, but it‚Äôs easy to navigate if you drive slowly. Stuart was a great host and his house is at the other side of the drive from the cabins ‚Äì close enough to offer help if you need anything, but far enough away to give you privacy. He offers a load of wood for a fiver for the fire and is happy to light it for you. He also gave the kids balloons so they could have a water fight. The cabins are all very quirky and different to anywhere else we‚Äôve ever stayed. The outdoor bath is one of the best bits of the place and the kids enjoyed being able to splash about in there and there is also a bath downstairs overlooking the river which is very relaxing in an evening once the kids have gone to bed. The river (which sounds great in an evening) is best accessed walking past Stuart‚Äôs house, as it‚Äôs a bit of a slippery/steep slope directly from the cabins. The kids enjoyed putting on old VHS films and watching them in an evening ‚Äì something they‚Äôve not experienced before (The VHS, not watching films). We were prepared for loads of spiders and insects with it being cabins, but were surprised that there weren‚Äôt many at all. After removing one spider from the kitchen on arrival, that was taller than I was, I was concerned the kids would be panicking, but there was really no need to worry. That spider left amicably and I only saw the odd one after that. There was plenty of space for two adults and four kids and it was nice to have such a decent outdoor space for them to play in. There is also a little kart and a bike for the kids to play on which they enjoyed. All in all, we had a great three night stay at Stuart‚Äôs place and would definitely visit again. It‚Äôs great for young children.",5

After 5 nights in this beautiful, peaceful location we feel fully rested. We were a group of 2 adults, 2 children. The outdoor baths and saunas were a massive bonus. The cabins are cosy and comfortable. The kitchen is basic, but totally adequate. You can hear the river from your bed, and dine around a fire, under the stars. Stuart was helpful and friendly. Great walks locally, including the gorgeous Pistyll Rhaeadr Waterfall, and Lake Vyrnwy. If you are used to camping, this is an upgrade! If you like being close to nature, in unspoilt beauty with fires, saunas and hot outdoor baths then this is the place for you.",5
8112,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Heather,"Excellent stay if you're looking for something different. Made such a nice change to caravan holidays in butlins! 

So much to see in the area. Lake Vrywny was brilliant!  You can hire kayaks for ¬£15. 

Welshpool is also close by. Or just drive around the country roads finding places to stop by the river. There was so much to see.

Our dog enjoyed playing in the river outside the cabins and any other rivers we found along the way.

Stuart was kind enough to light a fire for us on arrival and was very pleasant! He also provided us with a dustbin full of fire wood for ¬£5.

The Kitchen has everything you need microwave, gas hob, kettle and pot/Pans etc and there is also a small BBQ. (Bring some charcoal)

Bedrooms were clean, cosy and warm. 
Loads of VHS tapes to watch!

It really was so much fun.

If you don't like spiders/cobwebs and being outdoors then this isn't for you! 

The Airbnb review printed out and put on the back of the door in the thunder box made us all laugh ü§£.

Stuart was a helpful host but not over intrusive and lit fires for us. We usually go camping so it was lovely to have all the amenities we needed without having to take them with us saying that we did take our large camping chairs which provided us with extra comfort as we sat around the fire at night with our dogs.

It‚Äôs like camping, but with the best bathroom on the planet, outdoor bath and shower with boiling hot water, a kitchen and beds.

There's no sygnal at all so a good chance to have an internet detox and enjoy the beautiful nature. The night sky was absolutely incredible and the open walled bath is a unique treat. Stuart was really kind and helpful and helped us get the fire going and drew us a map.

BUT, it was one of the most peaceful spaces I've stayed in. The quirky outdoor indoor bathroom was lovely at sundown. the water was hot and plentiful the kitchen was small but practical. The bed dated but comfortable. Nothing is new, cobwebs almost out number the VHS tape collection and it feels a little jumbled together.

Stewart was great, welcoming  and friendly. He‚Äôs a very talented man and interesting to talk to. He left us alone to enjoy the accommodation but was there on hand if we needed anything.

My advice would be if you‚Äôre uptight, a clean freak or don‚Äôt like creepy crawlies then don‚Äôt waste yours, or Stewart‚Äôs, time by staying here. However, if you want a relaxing, quirky and alternative break and have an open mind, book it now!!

Stuart was a very kind and welcoming host; he helped us start the fire, lent us bikes to cycle round Lake Vrwyny and checked in on us to make sure we were OK.
It really is an 'off-grid' stay - we couldn't get any mobile phone signal or internet coverage at all. For this reason, it is a good idea to do your research before you go about what you want to do. But because we weren't distracted by our phones, we had some really good conversations. 
We had a great time cooking on the fire. We also enjoyed watching some of the extensive collection of VHS tapes- brought back memories! Also, be aware that the nearest shop closes at 6:00 -6:30 pm. 
The kitchen is basic but equipped with a stove, stove-top kettle, microwave, fridge and basic utensils. If you do intend to use the fire to cook, it is a good idea to bring some kindling, matches and a skewers. The water was nice and hot, great for the outdoor shower.

But the cabins were comfortable and warm, the beds were great and all the facilities were in working order.
Check in was smooth and communication was great.
Overall we had a really good stay and would stay there again if we are back in the area!",5
8141,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Jo,"We had a great stay and hope to visit again soon.
The location is beautiful and the rustic cabins and escape from reality and social media was exactly what we were looking for. 
Look at the pictures before booking, its exactly as you see in the pictures. There is no phone signal or internet. It's super quirky and we all enjoyed the outside baths and star watching. Stuart is really helpful and a really interesting guy. Our trip wouldn't have been the same without all his tips and advice. We were lovely and warm and it was great to sit around the firepit. The cooking facilities are basic but all we needed. We popped into the nearby town for breakfast and dinner and met some great characters there as well. The lake is beautiful and the nearby workhouse was also interesting.",5
8142,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Ella,"This was our second time staying at Stuart‚Äôs cabin and we loved it even more than the first time! Getting away from the City and having no contact with the outside world and no temptation to scroll through social media was exactly what we both wanted. 

We made use of the outdoor bath on each of our 3 night stay and ended up with slightly sore necks from constantly staring up at the amazing starry sky! 

We explored all around the beautiful Lake Vyrnwy on day 1 which is a short distance away. On day 2 we drove to Snowdon and climbed up and down back in time for the sunset, some time in the sauna, sizzling steaks on the fire, a bath under the clear sky and a VHS movie before bed. 

This place is perfect if you want to go back to basics, cook on a wood fire, be amongst nature and escape from the rat race of life. Stuart is incredibly welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. 

Highly recommend for a stay like no other and may return for our third visit at some point!",5
8143,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Romany,"A really amazing place to visit. The location itself is near a beautiful lake, and we drove about 1-2hours to get to a walk we had planned for Snowdon. Slight issue not having any WiFi/phone signal for maps, but Stuart was really helpful in giving directions. The space is an incredible bit of work and the pics show it well, the bath being a real highlight in the evening. I‚Äôve given the rating of cleanliness as 3, largely because it is outside and naturally there are cobwebs etc - but of course this did not affect the experience.",5

The location is amazing, in a beautiful valley overlooking a steam. It's amazingly peaceful! The cabins are great, super quirky and we took full advantage of the outside bath spending the evening looking up at the stars and listening to the water from the stream. No WiFi or phone signal means you really get the chance to switch off and enjoy being surrounded by nature! We will definitely be back!",5
8148,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Julie,"The scenery and the setting are absolutely stunning. The best memory is having a nighttime open air bath, looking out over the trees and the river.
The accommodation and facilities are basic and quirky and feel more like a camping experience. So, if you're looking for a boutique hotel this isn't for you. But if you want to enjoy all that nature has to offer then you'll love this place.
There are 2 outside baths and an outdoor shower. The water in the taps come from a well. There's a log store for a washingmachine drum BBQ. No WiFi. No telephone signal. A real step out of the rat race.",4
8149,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Cara,"Location is great, it felt like camping indoors. Was definately cold at night as everything is so open. Would benefit from a mobile fan heater to take to different rooms depending on where you want to socialise and a big rug in treehouse to block out cold. A summer retreat will be booked as Stuart was a wonderful and welcoming host. As there is no wifi or phone signal its worth thinking of taking a bluetooth speaker or cd music which doesnt involve wifi. Only personal to me as i like music. This place is very remote and very quiet, a perfect quiet retreat thank you",5

We‚Äôll be visiting again very soon.",5

If you love the outdoors and camping this place is magical. The sauna was perfect and the outdoor shower is great with a big square shower head to keep you warm even if its raining. Having a hot bath outside was the icing on the cake, we had a clear night, the rain stopped and we saw hundreds of stars. It was amazing. The place is so quiet you cant hear any cars so we sat outside on the porch for breakfast and dinner listening to the river. It's an outdoor experience so everywhere is open to the elements to some degree but the bedroom was always warm and cosy. Hopefully we will be back again. Definitely reccomend this place.",4

8162,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,George,"Outstanding! My partner and I stayed here for one night but regretted not booking a longer stay. We had the whole place to ourselves, and for the price we paid, it felt like an absolute steal. Despite being a genuine, back-to-nature experience, the entire complex was still very modern and clean. Why would you want to book a boring hotel room when you could stay somewhere like this? Couldn't recommend it enough! :D",5

Exactly as we wanted a break from our everyday lives! The sound of the river was fantastic whilst reading and enjoying a cuppa! 
Stuart was fab, great host, checking we were okay on several occasions during the stay. Heating was on for when we arrived so our rooms were snug! 
We used both indoor and outdoor baths, very relaxing! 
I think the listing is very honest and what you see is what you get! 
We will certainly be back again!",5

I never thought I‚Äôd enjoy having a bath outside so much. We were comfortable and toasty warm and truly relaxed and enjoyed our surroundings. Everything is in keeping with nature and the outdoors but the homely touches are something else. It‚Äôs so quirky and you get back to exploring and having fun. Having all the candles lit was truly magical and listening to the river. Just wonderful and we‚Äôll definitely be back.,5

Very rustic and brilliantly located within a river bottomed forest valley. The view is remarkable and surrounded by nature. True to say nature has slightly invaded the cabins just a little but it is to be expected! If you want pristine white marble go to London and book in at the Dorchester!! Sat around the fire pit made from a washing machine inner was great. Having no signal was great. (Try it) Bedrooms having VHS videos was great for last thing at night when the fire was dying. Perfect for exploring the area and the view from the outdoor living area is awesome watching the sunset!! Stuart the host is a lovely friendly interesting chap and was on hand if needed even to light the fire although being hardened outdoors types we managed okay!! Games and puzzles are available too. Don‚Äôt wear your Sunday best and you‚Äôll have a great time!! Brilliant!!,5

We loved the space, privacy, fresh air, out of the way location and great supply of old films on video. Our son discovered a love of the Simpsons. It's very well placed to visit Snowdonia and Lake Vyrnwy. There's a shop down the road that stocks mostly everything you need and excellent Welsh cakes.

8192,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Louis,"Stuart it was a pleasure staying at your property, we had arrived without notice due to signal issues and Stuart welcomed us warmly.
We are 4, 25 year olds and are quite picky when it comes to things. We love places which look and feel amazing, this place really is better in person than on the listing. 
I took my drone with my and shot amazing visuals around the area and the local big lake and Dam which only took 5 minute drive. 
The location is excellent and as this is an eco stay please be reminded signal on phones is very very limited! To the point you really have to go oldschool with the old maps and not on your phone.
But you drive 20 minutes away and you will receive signal.
(I mention this because for young people it's very important)
But please take what I say for signal not a bad point.
We all enjoyed not receiving anything from the outside world and only enjoying each others company.
My girlfriend really enjoyed the outdoor bath with candles lit and the fairy LED lights above gave an excellent effect. 
The space is fantastic you really could go here with 8 people and it wouldn't be an issue. 
Stuart provides you with more than what you need for a nights stay. We had extra plug in heaters for when it got cold, and more than enough extra bedding.
Stuart himself really helped us with our whole trip, as we only came because we wanted to hike in Snowdonia. Stuart provided us with directions to an amazingly scenic route along our journey to the mountains. This drive was breathtaking and we even saw wild horses roaming freely. 
Please also be aware of one other thing which really didn't cross my mind until I arrived back home, and that's the TICKS. I assume I got them from a waterfall which is by the big lake, but in damp conditions I think that's why. 
This isn't a negative thing as TICKS are found in various places in the UK in any damp conditions! 
I really would come back and visit Stuarts property again have I ever go to that side of the country.
All 4 of us give a rating of 5 out of 5. 
Thanks Stuart!

You could probably get two families there if you know them, would be nice gathering. Or a group of friends. 
You won't get signal so take a few games if the weather is bad. Stew was very accommodating with lighting a fire and offering a drink, if you need the help. Otherwise he respects your privacy.

Top tip follow Stew's written directions at the end when you turn of on the hairpin bend. Or you'll do what we did and have to reverse up an all terrain track.",5

Loved the country walks and great outdoor bath. Great for both a couple escape and family adventure.... We taking kids next time. Its a proper escape, so expect spiders and things, loved this better than any hotel. 

As for host.... He's a great guy. Greeted us on arrival and showed us around, started the campfire and got us plenty of wood, aloud us complete freedom around the entire area, even invited us in for a natter and drink. Really friendly and couldn't do enough.",5

A series of wooden cabins and tree house, it is certainly not a conventional holiday let. But we loved it and will definitely come back again. Be aware this is a little like a mixture of normal b&b and camping.

Stuart is a very friendly and helpful host and communication was very easy.

A highlight for us was the bath with an unhindered view of the river (ie no wall or window....it just looks out over the river.) You may think this might be a bit drafty, but we loved it after our swim in the river on a wet day in March. The shower also does not have a roof, and there is a second bath that is completely outdoors. Fantastic!! Lots of hot water too. Shame we didnt find time for the sauna.

The main bedroom cabins were warm and cosy and we had a comfortable nights sleep listening to the rain and the river.

If you like camping üèï without the hassle of pitching your tent and with all amenities at hand then this is your place!  

A few reviews mention the cleanliness as being an issue and this would be true if you were paying hotel prices!  (Camping clean) that‚Äôs what I would say! But mainly only the kitchen which has seen a lot of use. 

The hideout bath was absolutely amazing! Hot water in abundance and the campfire under the stars was lovely!  

Massive selection of VHS to chose from and every time you look a little closer you find a new random souvenir of some kind hanging around!  

I was skeptical on arrival but had the best time! Big bowl of chilli on the second night with some baked potatoes finished off in the fire pit! 

Lovely bubble bath with lots of candles and a glass of red whilst looking over the river! 

Definitely one to remember and will be back in the summer!

Did nearly get snowed in on the last day due to waking up to a layer of snow, no WiFi or phone signal so was worried a little but managed to get out after a few attempts!

Didn‚Äôt see much of Stuart but he did show us around and popped over on first night to light the sauna!

8210,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Matty,"My partner and I drove for 6 hours to reach Stuarts place for a one night stay, but it was worth every minute of the drive. Following Stuarts direction to the property made finding the accomodation a breeze. We were warmly welcomed with a glass of Pinot, pleasant conversation, followed by a tour of the grounds. We unfortunately arrived during storm Dennis, so as expected the pathways were very muddy and slippery, but this did not spoil our experience, the cabins have stunning views of the river that runs through Stuarts land, it has to be seen to be believed. 
We stayed in the main cabin, it is far from a shed but a properly built log cabin that kept us dry and warm! The whole place is very cute and cosy.
 The kitchen was well supplied with plates and cooking accessories and the bedroom has a small TV with a big choice of VHS to choose from
 Bathing outside in the storm is an experience I will never forget, and bathing in the skypod in the morning with the river running directly in front of you is simply amazing. Stuarts house is closer than it appears in photos, however it is downhill of the cabins offering privacy. 
 When we checked out we were kindly offered a cup of tea which we turned down as we had a long drive ahead, however Stuart made a point of insisting we visit the Lake and Dam, and we are thrilled he did so, as this was simply stunning.
 We can't wait to experience Stuarts property again in the warmer and dryer weather!.",5

We came to celebrate my daughter's 15th birthday and being outdoors types we love to get away from it all and experience something different.  The cabins were perfect for our needs and despite the temperature plummeting to freezing on a January night, they were warm and cosy.   Comfortable beds and plenty of bedding, blankets and towels.  So many great touches everywhere from the hundreds of tealights to the vast array of videos.  
Our favourite part was the baths.  One outdoors and one in the skypod, both open to the elements, we tried each one.  Piping hot water and plenty for both and I have to say that lying in a open air bath on a dark, cold January night looking at the stars is an experience that will stay with me!  Just wonderful.
Stuart was very welcoming, showing us all the facilities and he came back later to check we were ok, offering to light the campfire for us.  
All in all a fantastic stay and if you're after something a little different then this place is highly recommended!",5

I feel we bonded so much as a family. He kids loved the outside bath, I loved the bath in the hut & the little great tit that flew in each morning whilst I looked out down to the river.  The VHS collection was such a hit with us & the kids. So much to do on the doorstep.... the lake was stunning & the waterfall a beautiful find at the end of a superb scenic walk.

The outside baths are fantastic I could have stayed in these all weekend. The main bedroom hut was warm upon arrival, the sauna is a must after a long day exploring the lake nearby, it was what we needed to wind down. Overal you have everything you need and then a few experiences that you won't get with other properties like the outdoor baths and the old-style TVs with loads of videos, a nice touch on an already impressive place. Stuart is a wonderful host, suggesting local things to do and always being on hand if we needed anything. We are planning to come back already!

Stuart was a wonderful host who greeted us warmly and lit the fire for us. 
If you're expecting a hotel experience you will be dissatisfied, this is a Glamping experience. It's very close to nature.

 The toilet and kicthen are separate to the cabins so you have to go outside to access them. The shower is outdoors and doesn't offer much privacy from other guests in your party. 

The cabins we stayed in were lovely and warm with the heaters on however there is no heating in the kitchen or toilet. 
There was lots of hot water for the baths though and they are such a novelty! Bathing outside in the rain was amazing!
Stuart has the most impressive VHS collection and what a time warp that was, rewinding video tapes! 
This place is very unique and the surrounding area just beautiful. 
Highly recommend (but only if you're a bit outdoorsy)",5
8233,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Christina,This was an amazing place to stay. Very much looking forward to revisiting in the summer months with hopefully a little less rain!,5
8234,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Josh,"If you're coming for a relaxing / de-stress / weekend break or as a treat, then this place is ideal - a great find and worth the money!! The beautiful and peaceful surroundings, the sauna, the outdoor hot tub (note: it's a bath tub, but the water's hot enough to be close to a hot tub) combined with star-gazing on a clear night were brilliant!!
Note: I say it was worth the money as I was able to make use of the sauna and hot tub - i.e. make the most of what this stay has to offer. If you're coming just for an overnight stay, and not able to use the amenities mentioned, you may not find it as good value for money.

I stayed in the hut furthest. And it was a nice little room sufficiently furnished. Had a small TV with a VCR player and loads of VCR films - be prepared for nostalgia! And there's a kitchen next door, which was pretty well-equipped with a gas hob, some cooking pots and pans, a fridge, cutlery, crockery, a microwave, toaster, drinking water can, and even some basic things like oil.

Note that this is in part, an outdoor experience (bit like glamping). If you come expecting a hotel-like stay, you'll be unpleasantly surprised. But if you come expecting an outdoor experience, you'll be pleasantly surprised, as it was pretty good/better than I expected for an outdoor experience.

Stuart was a great host, welcoming me soon as I arrived, close by and available when help was needed, kindly turning on the heating in the hut I was going to stay before I arrived. And topping it all off, in the morning when I got stuck in the snow trying to get out, he was willing to help tow me up the hill!!


So all in all, I would recommend, and would personally consider going again!

Note on location: Be careful to follow Stuart's instructions regarding directions, rather than following Google maps or AirBnB's map.",5

Stuart was very welcoming when we arrived. If you do want to use the sauna you should tell him in good time so he is able to set it up,",4
8238,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Suraya,"Stuart place was a very quirky, fun  and give a ""camping experience"".
We had a good time with all the cassettes since the weather was with heavy rain. Stuart welcome us and showed the place around, was very friendly and funny. We asked for have the Sauna and he light up for us, unfortunately we couldn't use the bath outside because of the heavy rain. (Was too cold as well) The views are beautifull and the river sound is very peaceful.
We stayed in the cabins by the kitchen since this were the ones with the heating on.
The sky pod and the tree house were amazing but more a summer place. We visited the lake close by and was beautifull.
The sauna cabin had a bit of dump smell but I guess the Sauna brings a lot of humidity to the place.
We loved the skeleton in the entrance of the property, the zombie hand and all the quirky details but was a bit of a shame that the cleanliness wasn't so well. 
I love camping and hallowen is my favourite season but I beleive that the place with a bit more love and care would be even better. (At least toilet, shower and kitchen) Was very small drops of rain in my cabin, the toilet was full of drops every where, like a ""shower toilet"", the shower was with open roof what was a shame because with rain we didn't had a hot shower. The kitchen was greasy and full of spider webs with dead bugs on it. I do love the quirky and camping experience but like I said a bit of love and care and the place would have been perfect. I advise to separate the cabins on the booking site, guests will get only what they choose and is easier to prepare for guests to stay, avoids desapointment too. ( had similar experiences before and we even had a little welcome gift with local things) Overall we liked the experience, will come back but in a summer time.",3

If you fancy something which is a step up from camping, which is great value for money, then you will like this.  There is no light pollution so it is a great place to do star gazing and where else in the world can you lie in a warm bath outside and do star gazing! Stuart supplied us with logs for the camp fire and there is an outside picnic table so it was a great place for the four of us to socialise and enjoy the evening together. It is very close to Lake Vyrnwy which is a very beautiful area. Loved every minute of our trip so will definitely recommend Stuart's place to friends.",5
8245,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rosie,"Fantastic place, great host, stunning location! Dont really know where to start but we loved staying here. We are into our outdoor spaces and 'rusticness' so we had to try this place out. It was more lovely than the pictures showed and was definitely one of the most relaxing placed we've stayed in. If you are into camping whilst still having some of the home comforts then I'd definitely recommend it. The outdoor bath tub (and a second bath tub in an opened-sided bathroom) were the highlights for me - a bath under the stars listening to the sounds of the river was a new experience. Stuart is a great host who made us very welcome, he invited us in for drinks and let us use his internet (as there's no 4g in the area) and gave us tips about where to go. He even gave some toy ducks to our duck-obsessed 2 year old. We also made great use of Stuart's extensive old VHS collection in the cabins to pass the evenings, and our girl loved her introduction to some classic kids films. It's also in a great location with gorgeous countryside and a local shop a short drive away. We will definitely be back for another visit!",5

Thanks Stuart!!",5
8247,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Hannah,"We had an amazing stay here and enjoyed exploring the area, as well as climbing Crib Goch and Mount Snowdon (about 1 1/2 hours away).

We really enjoyed the quirky set-up; much more interesting than staying in a hotel, but more comfy than camping! There were old TVs and VHS tape players so we watched several videos from their selection which was a great rainy afternoon activity!

The outdoor bath and shower were super fun, and made a change from the usual boring routine you get stuck in! No signal/ internet which we liked as it was nice to just switch off and enjoy the beautiful countryside.

Stuart was a great host and provided extras like firewood for our BBQ which was very kind of him. We also had a drink with him one evening and it was great to swap stories. 

I would definitely recommend the stay, it's very quirky and unusual and not something you usually experience! The amenities are basic but there are heaters and plenty of hot water so it was comfortable all the same. Thank you Stuart!",5

8249,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Mike,"Entrance is via a ‚Äòsteep gravel track‚Äô, and you‚Äôll know you‚Äôre there when you see ‚Äòradiation risk‚Äô and ‚Äòbeware of the bull‚Äô signage with a severed hand and skeleton.  Despite passing a comment about these bizarities, the host greeted with a straight face before showing us the ‚Äòaccommodation‚Äô.

We had a choice of horrors. At best, the cabins are poorly made garden sheds, at worst they‚Äôre wooden hellscapes. The first thing shown was the outdoor bathtub (in full view of the hosts property) with a frightened rubber duck chained to it. An alternative ‚Äòshower‚Äô was no more than a floor of dirty concrete paving stones with green mould growing up the side.

The first cabin, ‚ÄòBisiker Towers‚Äô held a selection of VHS tapes, a dirty CRT tele, bunk beds, thick cobwebs and an overpowering musty odour. The bed linens were ancient and smelt it. I hazard a guess that they were last washed during the coal mining strikes.

We made our way past the ‚ÄúThunderbox‚Äù which was little more than a spider-infested portaloo.

The next cabin was the Juhannus, with a double bed, an even bigger selection of VHS tapes, some art work (a block of blue canvas, presumably covering something worse), its own selection of spiders, thick dust and a ‚Äòmemory box‚Äô drawer filled with various litter of previous victims.

Next, the kitchen shed. Everything was filthy. The host said to not drink the water, only to have it from a half-filled dirty plastic container.

Across a rickety bridge to the ‚ÄôSky Pod‚Äô,  you‚Äôll see a very used sofa bed, more musty sheets, and a trap door leading to a toilet.  On inspecting the toilet, you‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs open to the forest via a missing wall.  Romantic? It‚Äôs not as private as you think - you‚Äôre essentially in the hosts garden.

The third and final cabin was viewed.  There‚Äôs four in total but we didn‚Äôt get access to the other which legend says holds a sauna.  The ‚ÄòTreehouse‚Äô is another precarious-looking structure.  Inside from left to right is a wash basin from a caravan which dispensed brown water, a large clock on the ceiling, more spiders and dust, a sofa which clearly had a hard life and (like my now fleeting sense of self-preservation) deflated cushions, a selection of cobweb-covered cups, 3 ‚Äòquirky‚Äô Sports Direct bottles covered in literal dirt, a camping bed, a glass cabinet on top of which lived a dead sheep‚Äôs skull (killed by the lack of adequate hygiene) with a taxidermy bird inside. Two more musky beds, one with a spiders egg on it. The host asked if we were okay, we said yeah not wanting to know what was in the fourth cabin as we had no phone signal or WiFi to signal an emergency.

After a 5 minute discussion on the pros and cons of sleeping in the car, we went towards the nearest town to find phone signal and look up the nearest Travelodge. It felt safe and somewhat clean.",1

I cannot stop raving about Stuart's little haven. Sitting in a hot tub, protected from the wind, and an unobstructed view to the river and forest below.. for that price you'd be a fool not to visit. Stuart is the loveliest host, and we have now been back 2 years on the trot now. Cannot believe how lucky we are to have found this absolute gem. The lake near by, the chicken burgers from the shop close by, the locals, everything and everyone is to die for. We'll see you next year Stuart!!!",5

Only able to stay for 1 night but had a lovely time & had the whole place to ourselves. Found easily following Stuarts directions, private place where all you can hear are the river, birds and crackling of the fire!

8279,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Becky,"Very quirky and interesting stay at Stuart's place. The location is lovely with just a short drive away from Lake Vrnwy. Stuart was very helpful in telling us where to visit in the local area. When we arrived there he showed us the 3 cabins. One was heated up for our arrival which was a nice touch. Unfortunately his treehouse was still having work done to it when we arrived, which was a shame as we wanted to stay in there. We loved his little 3-legged cat who came to say hello, very friendly! The sauna was brilliant and well built, we enjoyed getting toasty on a chilly evening. Stuart has a huge selection of videos to watch on a classic old TV which we thoroughly enjoyed.

There are a few things to bare when booking:

The cabins are very dusty, 2 of which had thick cobwebs everywhere and spiders eggs along the ceiling which did put me off. The furthest cabin is the most maintained one so all 4 of us decided to stay in this one which was fine for us.

The facilities state 'Hot tub' but this is in fact an outdoor bath tub so bare this in mind.

The kitchen utensils, gas hob and pans are very dirty and oily, though this is a reflection on the previous guests, not Stuart as it is the guests responsibility to clean up after themselves which unfortunately people have not done.

Overall Stuart has put in a lot of effort into building these cabins/sauna and we must commend him on this. He is a very friendly and helpful person who we enjoyed getting to know and would be happy to stay here again in the warmer summer months.",4

8291,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kate,"Beautiful setting and quirky cabins, but hygiene was not up to standard. The bed had been changed but the surfaces in the cabin and kitchen and the fridge had not been cleaned - had old bits of food in fridge and kitchen surfaces, dust and grime on cabin surfaces, crumbs on chair in cabin etc.
We couldn't bring ourselves to stay one night because we had our baby, which we had been allowed to book with an infant, but we did not feel the hygiene and the draughty main cabin door was safe for a baby to sleep in or prepare food for in the kitchen.
If I had been paying camping prices I would not have minded, but this was alot more expensive and in my opinion, not worth it for the state it is currently in, as it has been left unloved and unclean.",2

Stuart is really helpful whilst also respecting your privacy and he has added some really lovely touches to the place such as a collection of VHS tapes, spare hats and candles to name a few. The outdoor baths were amazing we were able to enjoy a clear night sky whilst being in the bath by candlelight. And I would recommend using the bath in the sky pod in the morning to look out over the river it is a wonderful experience. We were quite cold the first night but the second night we used the extra blankets Stuart provided and then we were fine so if you are going make sure you use the blankets the place is quite back to nature but that is what makes it so charming. The treehouse wasn‚Äôt available for us to use which was disappointing as we were looking forward to using it but we didn‚Äôt really mind as we loved the cabin we ended up staying in and we are excited about what developments Stuart has got planned for the treehouse!

8303,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rebecca,"This place is amazing. make no mistake it is an outdoor space and thus there will be cobwebs and such however if you're not adverse to this and like a rustic stay then this is the prefect place for you. Some things to note are that the way you leave it is how other people find it, such like if you do not clean a pan it is the guests responsibly to clean up the kitchen items they use not the host. Also there are 2 baths, one is outside and completely exposed, the other is downstairs in the wood cabin on stilts and has a bit more privacy but still outside (the water as people have said is boiling hot). We stayed on a lovely mid week in Feb, cold on a morning and hot in an afternoon. The only issue was that it was so cold on a morning the shower door was frozen shut and the pipes to the bath frozen so we couldn't wash on a morning, also the outside toilet was frozen over but cant be helped. Stuart is an incredible host with plenty of hospitably, we were even luck enough o be invited into his home for a drink, he has created a truly remarkable place. The sauna is good but not red hot and also very wood intensive so have a bath instead as its much nicer in my opinion. kitchen is well equipped with everything for your needs and sitting outside with the fire on and grilling burgers is the memory ill hold the most.

All our plans for waterfall hikes and trips round the area were hastily rethought, and instead we explored Lake Vyrnwy - just a five minute drive away - and even then we needed 4x4! But it couldn‚Äôt have been a better place to be marooned, we lit the brazier outside, poured a G&T (no ice needed!!)  and enjoyed the solitude and clear star filled sky. Bliss.

Completely off the beaten track, secluded and still manages to be homely. A real explorers retreat. We arrived late and went straight in the bath, the water is boiling!! Stuart has left candles and matches everywhere giving it that extra touch, we then went to bed and watched a video from Stuart‚Äôs massive collection of classics. Our cabin was so toasty and warm, really cosy and the bed was really comfortable too. We got up and made pancakes (took our own ingredients) and it was so easy thanks to the perfect kitchen. We had a frying pan, spatular and hob, everything was incredibly clean. We then packed up and spent the day in Lake Vyrnwy which was amazing and only a short drive from the cabins.

It is possible to walk to Lake Vrynwy. The bedrooms in the main cabins have heating but wrap up warm in autumn/winter months if wanting to enjoy the outdoor space. Also if travelling in a group like we did be careful not to use all the hot water enjoying the luxurious baths leaving not enough to go round.  Stuart is a great host offering tips on the area and even ran us to the pub one night! As well as making us a campfire when we returned. All in all it was a really enjoyable stay and will definitely be returning..",5

8341,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Caitlin,"Stuart‚Äôs place is beautiful and me and my partner enjoyed being there. It‚Äôs very open plan and so it‚Äôs to be expected that there‚Äôs leaves and spiders because of the time of year and because of how open to nature it is, if these things bother you then it‚Äôs not the place for you. However if you enjoy being outdoors and in nature, taking a bath and watching the sun set and sitting by a fire then I would recommend. All the linen and bedding was very fresh the overall vibe of the place was very warm and welcoming.

Stuart is very helpful and friendly, he came each night to help light the fire, he was able to answer and questions we had and even offered to let us in his own home for a drink. We will defiantly book again.",5

8344,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kerry,"Rustic site, set in a beautiful area.  Slightly tricky to locate the small road leading to the complex so I would ask in advance.  You are at one with nature and basic living, however Stuart the host is exceptional and I can honestly say we had a fantastic time.",4
8345,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sam,"Wow! If you love nature and can cope without 3,4 or 5* luxury then this place is great to get away from it all ( no WIFI) and relax in front of the log burner looking up at the incredible stars and at 3am the Milky Way was also awesome to see!
So, Stuart is a lovely host,  he has cleverly built everything, and very eclectically furnished everything. There is no ‚Äúwomans touch‚Äù so do not expect a hotel room here, it‚Äôs fully functional, quirky, enjoyable but be warned, no toilet in the bedroom ‚Äú shed‚Äù so if you need to get up in the night frequently you might want to take a bedpan with you! 

Not suitable for toddlers ( a health and safety nitemare!) but older kids would love staying in a treehouse! 

Having a hot steaming bath exposed to nature watching the bats flying by and the breeze through my hair was an experience I will never forget.

We loved it!",5

I stayed here with 3 of my children (aged 8, 11 & 16) and we all had a brilliant time. Stuart really is a super host, going above and beyond to be welcoming and helpful. He took us out in the forest in his truck and showed us around the local area, invited us over for drinks, lit the wood burner each night, gave the kids water bombs and glow sticks ....... That said, he did not invade out privacy and the location is very secluded and peaceful. 
The outdoor bath and sky pod bath are beyond words and were one of the highlights of the holiday. 
Yes there are cobwebs etc but that's exactly what you should expect. 
Think of this as camping/glamping with the most amazing extras.",5

We stayed for 3 nights with our children (ages 6 and 3). The outdoor baths were great. The views amazing. Stuart was a very welcoming and friendly host.

The kitchen was very basic and limited on storage space for food. You need to take everything other than washing up liquid. There is no running drinking water, it is plentifully supplied in a large container. Lots of cutlery and crockery.

There were plenty of toilet rolls, clean bedding and towels. A great supply of night lights. 

We did not use the outdoor shower or sauna. We really enjoyed the outdoor fire and having access to plenty of wood. 

The views, the peace and the wildlife were outstanding. ",4

8361,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kaye,"Myself and my 8 year old son have just returned from Stuart's. We spent only 2 nights and i really wish it had been longer. 
Stuart rang me before we arrived to make sure I knew how to get there and check our check in time. He greeted us on arrival with a glass of wine and some really handy local tips. The cabins run adjacent to the side of Stuart's house but it is not overlooked and I still felt like we had privacy. The views over the dip in the valley and the river below are fantastic. We heard woodpeckers, owls and saw some big birds of prey. Stuart gave my son water ballons and a water pistol and encouraged him to ""go bananas"" so it was great feeling that i could just let him play without having to worry. The cabins were fantastic. The bedding and towels smelled fresh and there were plenty of utensils in the kitchen and soap and loo roll to use. As previous reviews state, they may be cabins however it is very outdoorsy so you will meet spiders, cobwebs and moths etc. We love all that so it was no problem basically living outdoors but with a roof. The cabins are comfy and cosy and well built. 
The bath......well my son spent a lot of time in it, it's fab!!! Water super hot and great to have a soak and relax. 
His land is vast and we had a lovely walk down to the river and did some paddling. There is a local shop in the village that does hot food and great bacon sandwiches. These set us up nicely for the journey home and the guy that runs the shop is lovely too.
On our last night Stuart had a friend round with some local children so that my son could play with them and we had a few drinks around his chimenea. 
Stuart is very welcoming and fantastic with children....my son will never be the same after a trip out on his quadbike! 
We really did have a fantastic time and will most certainly return in the future. ",5

Stuart as a host is very welcoming and friendly, and came over for a few chats with us and helped us with the fire pit. However he gave us a lot of privacy as well and left us to just get on with things on our own, which was also nice. Considering we were a group of teenagers aged 18-20, we never felt unwelcome at all - especially as we aren't exactly the quietest group. Stuart provided plenty of towels and there was more utensils than we thought in the kitchen - plenty of pans aswell as cutlery, glasses, bowls and plates. Overall, we had a lovely time and our only regret was that we didn't stay longer. ",5

Stuart was the perfect host - we felt relaxed and welcome even though we are not the quietest bunch. In response to the reviews about cleanliness; it's not clean because it essentially outdoors - if you want clean then don't go camping, stay in a hotel. Stuart provided plenty of towels, toilet roll, soap, kitchen utensils and crockery. The linen smelt clean as did the towels. There is wifi but it's sketchy. There is no phone signal so don't expect to be able to contact the outside world. We all enjoyed the lack of communication! The only thing I would suggest is that you bring your own bottled water - the taps are not drinking water and nobody likes drinking out of a plastic gerry can. The outdoor shower was lovely and hot as was the bath water (extremely hot actually). In the rain this place may not have been so lovely, but we were blessed with glorious weather and could not have had a nicer weekend. Thoroughly recommend and will definitely be returning. ",5
8380,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Paul,"A very quirky place - in a great way. From very soon after arriving we were already talking about coming back, and that only amplified during our stay. Host is lovely, and the place is both a great place to be and a great base from which to explore a really wonderful part of the world. There‚Äôs lots to do and see, and we really only saw a small fraction of it.

As a place to hang out and stare across the river at the bank of trees and the skyline it‚Äôs great. Kids were never bored and adults have a lovely space to sit and chat after sundown.

It‚Äôs probably not for everyone - lots that‚Äôs rough and ready, and it‚Äôs sort of ‚Äòsuper-glamping‚Äô, but the place is built with a lot of love and care, and the location is a stunner.

We really loved it.",5
8381,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Nicole,"Stuart is a lovely host and made our stay as pleasant as possible. Unfortunately it was pouring with rain and the toilet roof is in need of repairs as it leaks very badly, so I got soaked using the loo. The mats and loo roll were also soaked and the floor muddy. Cobwebs and dust are a given in the outdoors, but the kitchen was just too dirty for me to want to cook in so we went out to eat instead. The shower looked equally unappealing, but the outdoor bath is absolutely blissful. However, my partner was unable to use it in the morning as there were people walking about outside the main house and there is no privacy screening - so make sure to enjoy a bath when it's dark or very early in the morning.",3

8408,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Ella,Had the most amazing experience! So nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of City life and be surrounded by the outdoors. Didn‚Äôt miss our phones at all. Loved the VHS selection for when we wanted to chill indoors for a while. Really enjoyed getting the fire going and maintaining it. The sauna was also a great experience but the outdoor bath was something else! We were really lucky that the skies were clear so could bask under the stars. Managed to last about an hour is minus temperatures with a few top ups of hot water. Stuart was really welcoming and very helpful! He informed us of all the best spots to visit around the lake and was happy to answer any questions about anything! Couldn‚Äôt recommend more if you are looking for a quiet escape with a rustic feel. Definitely plan to return later in the year!,5

The lake is much closer than we thought and the walks are lovely. Best feature is definitelythe outside bath which you can get in even when the temp drops to near freezing as the water is so hot. Nice view from the cabins and really quiet/secluded location. Stuart is really lovely and came over for a chat one evening, gave us some useful tips on what‚Äôs nice to see which was nice. He was very respectful of privacy though. Will definitely be back in the summer!",5

We did not have internet or signal throughout our duration and it couldn't have been better. The only time we reached for our phones was to snap a picture of the scenic surroundings, stream and lake. If visiting in Winter starting up the camp fire, relaxing in the sauna and running a hot outdoor bath under the stars is a must. There were plenty of candles to enioy and Stuart was kind enough to invite us in for a drink and chat.  We look forward to a return visit.",5

The weather was a bit unfortunate for us but we still had a lovely time. Just chilling in the surrounding and having a trip around the lake as well as food out and a few drinks. The selection of old videos we found a lovely touch and the outdoor bath was perfect. Only thing I would say is the dog hairs in the room.. not a big deal as I understand there's dogs on the property. It's just they were on the bed and with a small baby they were getting in his mouth. But regardless all round it was lovely. Thanks Stuart.,4

Even with the rain pouring down most of the time the cabins were great! Perfect, rustic living. Hot water, heating in the rooms and a fully functioning kitchen made for a pleasant clamping experience. The outdoor shower and bathtub are great! The sauna too!

The outdoor bath a revelation! Ok so the cutlery/plates are as the previous guests left them (may need re-cleaning) but that's not a big deal for us. We didn't have use of the sauna this time but the outside bath was a treat! The bedroom has a heater on all night so we were very warm and cosy. There is no toaster or grill so bear that in mind for breakfast options. 
If you're driving down the B4396, at the end of the road (tiny petrol station thing on the right), take a left rather than follow signs towards the lake. So you're heading away from the lake.",4

The location was absolutely stunning and the cabins were perfect for our trip. The river is a lot closer than we expected which was fantastic and the bath tub was incredible! As expected the place does get cold without the heater on and there are cobwebs and spiders in the kitchen and toilet (what do you expect from an outdoor cabin) but all the facilities are really clean and well looked after and the heaters and water gets really really hot. Stuart was a great host and looked after us really well. The hill is steeper than the pictures show so may not be suitable for toddlers but the pictures for everything else does not do this place enough justice. If you stay here I'd absolutely recommend driving around the river and stopping off to do the walk to the waterfalls. Cannot wait to return :),5

It was a cross between camping and glamping, with a picturesque view of the river and forest ahead of us.  The log cabin was already warm and cosy when we arrived and our host Stuart was very accommodating and not far away should we need any additional help.  The Sauna was available for use and a great fire pit and outdoor seating for a fresh evening out to watch the stars.  Not far away was the great Lake Vyrnwy with various walks around the area to your preference.  Stuart was friendly and invited us into his home for a glass of wine and a tour around his country Cottage.

8442,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Shaunie,"Unfortunately we arrived a little later than expected due to my partners late finish from his shift as a paramedic. We were greeted with sarcasm and disappointment as Stuart had put a fire up for us but sadly had gone out before we arrived. We only stayed for a small amount of time before leaving again. The only reason we left was purely because of the lack of cleanliness and hygiene. We are from the countryside so we understand a few spider and webs but this was a unkempt infestation, with false widow spiders. Not only this but the kitchen was beyond filthy, tea stains, grease on cutlery, rancid food in bottom of fridge. The floor looked like it had not even been swept or clean as bottle caps were scattered all over the floor. The linen looked old and due the filthy setting  did not feel confident that they had even been cleaned. Stuart's house over looks the entire log cabin area and is very close on site which disappointed us as we believed it was private and ""secluded"" we felt misled by the lack of information and photographs provided. Also beware the narrow lane leading to the accommodation as it is very unsuitable for road vehicles we scraped and scratched the bottom of the car driving up and down it. We were so disappointed as the cabins were in a perfect setting and it was such a shame that they were not and probably not ever kept clean for clients paying to stay in them.",1

Yes it could be cleaner but for guests who moan about lack of a mobile signal (yawn) and cobwebs (really?!) all that I can say is 'get a life'.

It's like paradise in The Welsh countryside! We explored 2 local waterfalls and did some of the treks around the local lake.

Stuart was a great host, he couldn't do enough for us and when we had to change our arrival time at the last minute he was very accommodating. Take your own food and toiletries. We cooked over the fire but there is also a microwave, pans etc. and a kettle in the kitchen.",5

It's an amazing experience especially for someone like me who doesn't like camping but wants to enjoy the outdoors. It's very serene, especially at night. You wake up to the birds singing and the sounds of the river flowing, absolutely refreshing. The outdoor bathtub is lovely especially at night surrounded by glowing candlelight. The outdoor shower is very nice as well. The water was always hot. The kitchen is functional, we cooked breakfast and had BBQ in the evenings. We brought our own food in a cooler box as the local shop only has limited food options. Stuart kindly drew a map for us to walk to Lake Vyrnwy and back to the cabins about 6miles. We then drove out again in order to walk to the waterfall as the lake is a 12mile round trip. 

Warning, this is not glamping. You will have spiders webs and insects around you. The place could be cleaner but it's value for money. ",4
8458,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Gemma,"This place is a lovely little gem away from the real world. Even though it is outdoor cabins the heater worked great and although it rained for hours and hours it was still lovely to be all cosy and watch a film. The kitchen has all you need for cooking and the local shop, though a bit pricey, has excellent meat. We cooked it on the little BBQ provided and had a great time sitting on the porch watching the rain. There's also a video player and an excellent selection of actual VHS tapes, which made me very happy. 
Of course, the most unusual and special detail is the outdoor bath. Once it stopped raining we ran a lovely hot midnight candlelit bath (candles provided too!) and it was just amazing out in the middle of the countryside. 
Phone reception is not good here but great if you want to switch off from the world. 
The place is a little tricky to find but Stuart was on hand to help us find it and a very welcoming host. He made sure we had everything we needed and the view over the river is lovely.
The next day we headed to the nearby lake which has stunning views and impressive dam.

Stuart himself was very friendly and welcoming.
The accommodation was more or less what we expected, and the bathtub under the stars exceeded my expectations and is something I won't soon forget. So in that sense BOOK IT.
However, the place needs a very good clean. We've stayed in similar cabins before, and we're certainly not fussy.
But apart from the many cobwebs and mustiness in the bedrooms, the cooker and counter were sticky, all the teacups stained, and the fridge hasn't been cleaned in a good while. There were sponges and a dishcloth, but even those were old and dirty.
Also I'm not sure if we were supposed to ask Stuart for breakfast, but there wasn't anything provided. There was a pack of tea amongst the sticky bottles of spices, and that was it. We asked for coffee and sugar (and later, hot chocolate) and Stuart couldn't have been more generous. I don't know if he was caught unprepared, but judging by other comments, this is the norm.
My friend and I would stay again as we're fairly easy in that sense, and it is a wonderful experience, but I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending the accommodation to anyone else.",4

Totally peaceful and removed from the hectic pace of day to day life it offers a great opportunity to get back to basics and spend some quality time round a roaring fire under the stars.

8468,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rob,"Stuart's cabins are beautifully situated. We loved the bath and the setting. However... My main gripe is that the place was not clean. In fact, I would describe it as absolutely filthy. I do not have particularly high standards and we had expected cobwebs and a bit of muck, but this was simply something else. None of the floors had been swept and all the sheds had grass and muck all over the floors. The kitchen was simply filthy with a cooker with someone else's food still all over it and a fridge with crumbs and sticky stuff on the shelves. The pans had been washed up but had food debris on them and the cutlery was covered in grease. The tables were sticky. The cutlery tray was simply disgusting. Even the kettle was horrible. We went out the second day and bought some cheap stuff to cook and eat with. In one bedroom and the treehouse the basins looked as if they had not been cleaned for months - this was truly foul. One bed had a plate of congealed food under and another a crisp packet. The treehouse had a bin full of rubbish and everything in it was covered in grime. I had planned to let my children sleep in here and they were disappointed that I stopped them. All the bed linen was old and not properly clean and in one cabin the bed really damp. The really disconcerting thing was that when Stuart arrived with an effusive welcome he seemed genuinely taken aback that we found the place unacceptable. He was genial and friendly but did not apologise or offer to clean the place properly. He even commented to another of our party (my elderly mother) that I was ""a right barrel of laughs,"" which I thought very rude considering I had been extremely polite to him despite being bitterly disappointed with the place. I should point out that my mother was herself so upset with the grim state that she offered to pay for us to go to a hotel, but was too polite to say anything to Stuart herself. On the second day my eldest, 9, woke and sat up in the top bunk to find herself covered in cobwebs (and this was not just a tiny one in a corner - this was months of no cleaning). My 5 year-old lost her bedsock under the bottom bunk and came out covered in dust and grime and cried. This was just horrible. My own shed was no better. Could Stuart maybe clean the windows once in a while? This was like the inside of a garden shed after some years of spiders and dirt. If you now wonder whether I may just be a complaining, cleanliness-obsessed idiot then please get in touch and I will send you some photos. We live in an old and crumbly house in a very rural area and are used to basic facilities and a lack of modern...",2

I asked him where was the lake and he actually drove me there to show me which I thought was very kind. The surroundings are brilliant, the tree house fab.

It's secluded, idyllic and a million miles away from this fast paced life we have to live. I would definitely recommend this place if you're after seclusion, peace or a romantic time. Stargazing in a hot tub was a beautiful experience when having no light pollution, you could even see the cosmic dust. The bed in the main bedroom is fantastically comfy too.

If your expecting centre parks - look elsewhere!

If your looking for a relaxing, different , off the beaten track, getting away from it all ""glamping"" experience - this is for you!

We loved it, despite the cold wet weather, we can't wait to return. 

Stewart was great, made us feel comfortable and welcome.

Loved sitting outside toasting hot Cross buns on the open fire.  

The vhs collection was great, loved laying in bed watching videos. 

Our only issue was the very rough track to the property. Stewart had warned us, but even our Audi A3 was scraping the underside. Really a 4x4 is needed unless the track is levelled a little.

We will return!

8506,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Peter And Rosie,"Although we only met briefly due to us arrivingly late and leaving early Stuart was kind and helpful.
The area is stunning and if you just want to get away from it all this is the place for you !
The area is beautiful and the lake stunning.
We slept in the main bedroom which was lovely and cosy and had a great nights sleep.
The kitchen is basic but has a microwave and a double hob so basic meals are the order of the day, think camping and you will not go far wrong.
Just wrap up warm , open a bottle of wine put on your favourite music ( you will need to supply music ) and chill out under the stars or inside the cosy bedroom.
Recommended for those that want to leave the facebook society behind !",5

The scenery was stunning and bathing in all weathers (including snow!) was incredible. We came prepared with lots of layers as it gets quite cold but the cabin we slept in was very cosy and we really enjoyed choosing our vhs selection for the weekend. The kitchen was a bit cold but it was fine for making big breakfasts in the morning before heading out. Stuart was really helpful and invited us in for a cuppa.

Despite the cold and rainy March day we used the outdoor shower that night. Without outdoor light and only candle light it, made the whole experience  perfect. 

Phone signal out there is spotty at best, so we were cut off from the world, which was relaxing.

We recommend to get to his place before it gets dark, as that will make it harder to navigate especially when it is raining.

We had a great time and we will be back.",5

Just a few minutes drive from the beautiful Lake Vyrnwy, Stuart's accommodation is tucked away amongst the Welsh forest. The main cabin (which is where we stayed) is warm, cosy and comfortable. The outdoor shower is fantastic, the sauna is a brilliant experience but the outdoor bath under the starlight is the best of all - unbelievable! 

Stuart was a great host, attending to every need and even inviting us in for a drink. We will definitely be returning!",5
8514,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Luke,"What can I say, Stuart was the best host and the reviews about him are 100% accurate. He makes sure that you have everything you need and will go above and beyond.

He makes sure he is around when you need him but gives you the space you want so you can feel like you have your own private getaway.

His plan is amazing, the log cabins and tree house are wonderly crafted and makes you have the best outdoors experience. If you like the outdoor, camping and the beauty of nature, this place is for you.

If you are expecting the Ritz with not a spec of dirt of dust then save yourself some time and Stuart's time. This is a back to nature experience, you have a heated room, Kitchen with hot water, sink etc and amenities but it will be cold, there will be some cobwebs and sheep. That is the best part about it!

When we looked at other reviews we heard about the VHS collection and what a collection. Of course in the valleys in Wales you won't pick up any signal, wifi or television but you can watch over 100 classic movies.

The best part about the trip is the outdoor bath. We never got to gaze at the stars as it was cloudy but being outdoors in a bath sunk into the hillside, there is nothing more perfect with a drink and some candle light.

If you are looking to get away for the weekend with a fab host who was helpful, in a place with picturesque views away from the busy day to day life, stay here...you won't regret it.",5

The smaller details such as the outdoor bath, the pile of VHS cassettes & ample collection of tealights really charmed myself and my girlfriend. The road getting in was quite undulating so be sure to bring a car that has adequate ground clearance!

Stuart was very helpful - offering bikes & assistance when possible. He started the outdoor fire which was much needed out in the cold but actually the interior warmth was more than sufficient. Overall a great place to stay! Thanks Stuart. ",5

We stayed in the large cabin adjacent to the kitchenette. It was clean, tidy, (warm) and piled sky-high with a brilliant selection of video tapes. The bathing facilities are basic but all work splendidly; a great shower with plenty of hot water and a unique outdoor bathtub, (great with candles, a bottle of bubbly and a Lush bathbomb!) The kitchen was functional and kitted out with a gas stove, sink, fridge, kettle, microwave and all kitchen equipment needed for basic cooking (no toaster though.) Stuart was a great host and touched base with us to ensure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. We truly had a fantastic trip and would recommend Stuart's place to anyone wanting to explore the beautiful Welsh countryside in a picturesque and unique setting. ",5

The outdoor bath was a highlight, with plenty of hot water available.  The cabin we slept in had a huge collection of classic VHS tapes to watch, and was nice and cosy.  It's a little bit isolated so don't make our mistake if you're arriving in the evening, and remember to bring some food with you! The local shop closes at 6 and the next nearest place with a big shop is a 30 minute drive away, this is no slight on Stuart's place, just a tip from a couple of fools that didn't bring any dinner! Stuart is a very friendly and accommodating host, but he's more than happy to leave you to it once you're all set up and ready to go.Overall we'd highly recommend staying here if you like a unique and rugged experience in a fun and isolated place.

We visited in January so yes it was cold. Even woke up to snow the next morning. We had a lovely evening in front of the fire pit and thoroughly enjoyed the sauna. Stuart is a lovely host and worked hard to ensure that we had a comfortable stay. 
We were encouraged to enjoy the local area and we very much did. The local rspb site was amazing. 
We found the kitchen to be a bit too cold to sit in which was a shame but it did not bother us too much. 
The beds are super comfy and warm once you settle in.  We all had a great nights sleep. 
Showering in the snow was a first time experience for us. 
I would definitely recommend staying here for the unique experience. 
If you visit in the colder months then go prepared as the accommodation is geared to the outdoor lifestyle. Warm clothes are a must. 
We look forward to visiting in the warmer months. 
Thank you for being such a good host Stuart.

8532,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kevin,"Be warned this is very basic accommodation. We went  for a long weekend in November from Thursday night to Sunday, However we left Saturday morning as description not accurate.
Stuart the host is very amiable and very helpful always checking to see if your ok. The views are stunning. those are the good points.
These are not LOG cabins they are large sheds, there is no living space so you are confined to your bed I know we went in November but the convector heater in the main shed is not adequate unless you have multiple layers on. 
No heating in Kitchen so eating in there was not possible and if more then 2 of you there is no room.
Outside shower is no more then an area between the 2 sheds with a shower door put on and you stand on a concrete slab after you clear all the leaves and muck away.
Sauna and outside BBQ were not used as they needed a quite a fierce heat to get them started.
A small point is that all rooms have TV's but there is no signal so you have vhs videos to watch.
Woke up on Saturday morning to no hot water, which was the last straw so we left.
This is not a reflection on Stuart, just the accommodation. ",2

8534,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Corinna,"We stayed one night at the cabin. If your looking for something out of a hoseasons catalogue, then this is not for you.  However if your looking for a beautiful cabin, with plenty of space to share with your nearest and dearest or just get away from it all, with its beautiful rustic charm,then this is the place for you!
From everything from the wood burung sauna, up cycled firepit, to the outdoor bath, the whole place leaves you feeling completely relaxed. It is set in beautiful surroundings and during our stay we were lucky enough to use the outside bath, starring up into the clear night sky and see 2 shooting stars! 
Stuart was a great host and had time to come and chat with us and he couldn't be more helpful. Bottom line is we will be returning for more than 1 night next time.
One thing I would say is make sure you go in suitable transport, as a lowered sports car, isn't the most practical mode of transport down the track to Stuart's place. ",5

The trip was excellent. From the word go Stuart was friendly and helpful, he took me and the boys down to the village by the lake and should us around when we first arrived which made a great start to the trip. Without going on - beautiful scenery and long walks, starry nights in a hot bath, fires and toasted marshmallows. 
BRILLIANT TIME.

It's warm and cozy, the scenery is breathtaking and there's lots to do in the area. Stuart kindly took us on a woodland drive to the local pub and we saw the sunset over the lake. We had a fees beers round the fire and then watched old movies on the VCR. In the morning I had my coffee in the outdoor bath tub which is set in to the hillside overlooking the woodland (really hot water!) and then we went to see the waterfall and lake in the afternoon. Great night away wish we could have stayed longer! ",5

If you like quirky and different, then this is the place for you. Located in a lovely little valley close to Lake Vyrnwy, you wake up to the sound of birds and the nearby stream. 
Stuart was an excellent host, very accommodating and friendly, even though we were running late on arrival. He made sure we had everything we needed, showing us how to use the homemade sauna (sow-na!), hot bath and other amenities. A fantastic host, and not over-bearing. 
Really hot water is available any time for the outdoor bath and shower, so don't worry about that. ",5

The cabins are amazing, clean, wholesome and tucked away in the most beautiful of surroundings nestled in a forestry valley with the sound of a stream flowing below. We had an enchanting evening with Stuart and his friends, exchanging songs and stories. Everything was just so easy and relaxing and we will definitely be returning in the future when it's time to get away from it all again. It's a short drive to the amazing lake Vyrnwy where one can walk to the amazing waterfalls. Stuart is an amazing host and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed as well as providing an evening of wonderful entertainment. The piece de resistance for me is an outdoor bathtub with hot water where one can relax under the stars. Thank you Stuart and see you again :)",5

I'm not sure I can do the log cabin, Sky pod, outdoor shower and bath, location and most particularly Stuart, justice. 
What a host! What a place!

All I can say is everything was perfect right from the start. I slept soundly and woke up to the sound of the river. Stuart took me to meet his friends at the local and had a cold beer ready when I got back from a loooooong bike ride around the lake (this is a must!!)

What Stuart has created is mind blowing and if you are thinking about going ... Don't think. Just go. Even the cleanliness of the outdoor toilet  would put most bathrooms to shame. The facilities including the kitchen are everything you will need!

Spending time here was like staying at a second home - that's how welcome Stuart and his friends (thanks Shan) make you feel!

Make sure you check out Di the  dragon!!

I will be back for sure! 
Thanks for a great holiday Stuart!!!",5

From the outdoor bath and washing machine drum fire, to the old school video movie selection and cosy kitchen, the place was perfect. Certainly not glamping but far more interesting and unusual.

From Saunas, to old style videos, to outdoor showers and baths, to unique (and sometimes scary!) d√©cor, Stuart's place delivers on fun, frivolity, getting back to nature and just chilling out.  Its hard to describe the feeling of running between the sauna and outdoor bath in the rain, listening to the wind in the trees and river below and taking in the view of the forest. Stuart himself is a true gent, kind and patient when we got lost and generous in his time showing us the lovely dam.  Also a really interesting and creative guy with lots of stories to tell.  Place is hard to find so read his directions before you leave as hard to get mobile connection (I didn't!).  Also bring your groceries with you as there is only one corner shop that you need to drive to.  This place is out of the way but it is one you will not regret going to especially if you have children.  This place is what memories are made of!  Thanks Stuart....loved it! x",5

The place consists of several cabins with great little details sprinkled all over. The view of the stream is beautiful, and can be greatly enjoyed from the outside shower or bath.

It's a good place for a BBQ and sitting around the fire, enjoying the view of the woods, and the stars at night. 

The treehouse and porch are fantastic extra's that make the whole thing even more special.

I chose this place as I liked the description of the cabins and sauna, and found that everything was as described, only even better! If you are used to outdoor living/camping but want a bit of luxury for a change, this will be perfect for you. If you are new to camping, this will suit you too, as we were amazed at all the mod-cons laid on - electric lights, HOT running water, plumbed in flushing toilet, yet all within a beautiful, peaceful valley, with the sounds of running water and owls at night. I particularly loved the outdoor bath, watching the clouds scudding past and the moon rising through the trees. The attention to detail that Stuart has put in is incredible, everything has been thought of to make your stay as comfortable and practical as possible. Stuart set up the fire for us when we arrived and was friendly and welcoming. We loved our stay here and would definitley recomend it.",5

He was happy to get the campfire going for us, and kindly lent us his cafetiere. There were candles everywhere which was a nice touch. The cabin we stayed in looked out on a ravine, very private and secluded and we enjoyed the soothing sound of the stream. There was plenty of hot water which was a real bonus when camping. Stuart was also full of suggestions for things to do while in the area. There are some very pretty walks around the lake, a waterfall walk which we particularly enjoyed, and the cafe/restaurant at the Lake Vyrnwy Hotel is a must visit for the views.",4

It is somewhere on the scale between a fully equip home and camping, so much like glamping. We all loved the experience, the finish Sauna, the out door hot tube and cooking on the barbecue. 

The fact that there was no mobile signal was an added bonus for me. And wifi is only available at Stuart's place, making the cabin ideal to getaway from the stresses of modern life. The setting is truly beautiful, with the views from the cabin looking on to a woodland around a small valley (that Stuart owns!). There are many outdoor activities and walks close by.

The man Stuart himself is a great host, very flexible and concerned with our well being (when we went for a walk in a storm he went looking for us!). If you're lucky he'll tell you one of his many interesting stories. ",5

He also invited us over to his place for a glass of wine next to his fireplace with his delightful cat curled up by our feet. The cabin was of a cosy and rustic build that Stuart put together himself!! There was a river running right at our doorstep of the cabin. It was most incredibly to wake up to the sounds of water rushing through the river, birds chirping and trees rustling. There was also a treehouse near the cabin which he just completed at the end of our trip. ",4

Visiting in February, it was cold on the evening making the showering an experience! With what seemed to be an unlimited supply of hot water we had no trouble keeping warm in there- it was getting out which proved to be difficult. Alternately there is the outdoor bath but we opted to get  in the Sauna as quickly as possible, and stayed there for the rest of the night. 

Stuart was very welcoming. Upon arrival we realized we forgot the tonic for our gin so instead of pointing us to the local shop, we were welcomed into his home for a drink and to be provided with a bottle of tonic. We also received a tour of his amazing home!

Will hopefully be visiting again in the summer to make the most of the outdoor area and maybe even the tree house!",5

The cabin was warm enough for February, clean and comfortable and the outdoor bath was amazing - even with the rain drizzling on our faces.
Stuart is an extremely kind and accommodating host, giving you privacy when needed but also happy to have a chat and a drink if you want.

They are set very close to a riverbank and listening to the sound of the water while looking up at the innumerous stars while sitting in a deep, hot bath was the best possible way I could think of to round off a day in this particularly beautiful and rugged part of the UK. Despite the howling wind and rain the cabin was comfortable, warm and clean and we both slept very soundly. I should also mention that Stuart himself could not have been kinder or more welcoming and we will without doubt be back later on this year!",5
8599,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Nath,"Fantastic experience. Stuart has built three cabins, which was perfect for our group of five. The whole set up is really unique, at the top of a valley with a river running nearby and a whole lot of peace and quiet. 

We stayed over New Years, so it was a bit cold out. However we were able to warm up with the heaters in the cabin, and with the homemade sauna and bath tub. All great features! 

One area for improvement in heating terms is that the second cabin, with the bunk beds, was a bit colder than the other two cabins. Meaning we ended up having four to a double bed in the warmer room. This was fine for us, but could be improved in the future for other winter guests (wouldn't be a problem in summer).

Would highly recommend the experience if you're looking for a peaceful retreat in nature. ",5

We were delayed due to traffic and a missing bag at the airport, which made us arrive extremely late. However, Stuart was very kind about it, and was very patient with us while we navigated the rural roads to try to find his place. If you follow his directions, it isn't too difficult to find, even in the dark! Just don't follow your GPS!

Stuart also provided us with great information about the surrounding area and fun nature walks to do. The next night, even though it was very late, he was kind enough to setup his sauna and the outdoor bath under the stars for us. Even in winter, the room was toasty and warm, and the setting was beautiful. However, we will certainly try to return in the summer months!

We Got there late (9pm ish) and he got the fire going as well as the sauna. Perfect end to the day.

The cabins were great and if you want a different experience to being in a hotel and prefer being out in the wildes, this is just the ticket. Make sure to go and see the near by lake.

I'll definitely be going back and that says it all really.

When we returned Stuart had put the heaters on for us and all or stuff in the cabin as previous occupiers were still there when we left. It was nice to come back to warmth as it was a rather chilly night. Got a great nights sleep after watching a quick episode of only fools and horses. In the morning Stuart lent me his phone as my mobile got zero signal so I could ring the hotel to check for my lost jacket. Nothing seems to be a hassle for Stuart, very friendly and hospitable!",5

It is such a fabulous place in the most wonderful location. Stuart was extremely kind, helpful and friendly. He couldn't have been a better host, ensuring that my friends and I had a great experience. There are too many positives to mention, but the fab views, the outdoor bath and shower and the great skydeck with its smoking dragon are some that come to mind.",5

We will definitely be returning!",5
8617,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Marie-Louise,"The approach to the cabins was certainly out of the ordinary, so much so that we weren't sure if we were at the right place! Stuart assured us we were and invited us in for a cup of tea. This is camping but with the comfort of a real bed and heater if the night is a bit chilly plus the added advantage of not having to deal with soggy canvas and damp things which we certainly would have done if we had been in a tent as we had some real downpours. It was lovely to look across at all the trees from our warm dry cabin. We are not talking five star luxury here so if it is glamping you are after then look elsewhere. You would however be missing out on the fabulous outdoor shower not to mention the bath! Stuart was very kind providing toys for our grandson and making sure everything was OK. He even lit the chimenea for my daughter and son in law (they stayed a bit longer and had the good weather). They said it was lovely to sit in the sky pod under the stars, they also took full advantage of bathing under the night sky too. Stuart's cabins are quite unique, not flash or super sophisticated, kitchen equipment is fairly minimal e.g. bring a sharp knife and other bits and pieces if you are wanting to rustle up flash meals. A stay in the cabins will however provide you with a very memorable holiday experience.",4

8619,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Julie,"This place is completely  bonkers but in a very good way. We had so much fun: a lovely walk by the river, dinner outdoors overlooking the wild landscape, piping hot al fresco bubble baths, drinks and a nice chat with our host on the treetop deck by a roaring chiminea fire... My daughter enjoyed the eclectic selection of videos in the cabins and we all liked the quirky way the cabins have been put together. 
It is several notches up from camping but still a great back-to-basics experience.",5
8620,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Nicole,"Stuart was a great host, and made lots of effort to stay in touch before we arrived, ensuring that we knew how to locate the property and that we had enough beds, etc.
He went out of his way during our stay, to help out with a flat tyre, moving the car for us and fitting the spare, which allowed for us to continue with our plans to visit the local hotel for a spa treatment. This was so helpful of him and a testament to his kind nature.",4

The cabins are set in beautiful grounds and there is everything you need for a perfect holiday retreat. It certainly is different in the best possible way. The outside bath was a real plus for the children who were both sorry to leave.

The host, Stuart, is a friendly, warm character who is also extremely helpful and made sure we had everything we needed.

We will be going back and hopefully it will be sooner rather than later. 

Many thanks Stuart for a lovely break.",5
8623,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Dane,"Amazing, the outside bath was out of this world and what was needed after a long day driving. The log cabins were great and the amenities were up to scratch. We had a great stay. ",5
8624,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Stephanie,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been written. We just returned from 3 nights at Stuart's cabin and had a wonderful time. As others have said, it's very rustic - don't go if you're expecting 5* luxury. However, it's in a beautiful location, you have everything you need, and Stuart is a kind, welcoming, and friendly host. He's happy to sit and have a drink and a chat, and is more than happy for you to have a wander through his property, where you can wander through meadows, visit sheep and wallabies, and see the beautiful river Vyrnwy. However, he also gives you your space. It's the perfect mix of company and privacy, and he's a lovely, engaging person to talk to. 
We didn't end up trying out the sauna, but the tub under the stars was amazing, and we were able to cook simple meals easily in the small kitchen. 
The location of the cabin is perfect; only a few minutes' drive from Lake Vyrnwy, close to Snowdonia, and not too far from the coast either. Stuart is happy to give recommendations on nice places to visit; we took his advice each day, and weren't disappointed!
We'd happily go back any time, and wholeheartedly recommend Stuart's cabin to anyone wanting either a rustic cabin getaway, or a fun glamping experience. ",5

8627,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Karen,"Stuart is a wonderful host- genuine, helpful and friendly .   Staying here was a bit like upscale camping- in the middle of nature, with a fantastic view and the sound of the river running at the bottom of the hill!  Kitchen facilities are fairly basic, but we managed fine, cooking ourselves a couple of meals and enjoyed them on the picnic bench outside.  Though we visited in July, the rain set in making it cold in the evenings, but the cabin was nice and warm.  The outside shower was hot, powerful and good fun, especially in the rain and the outside bath with a starry night and candles was wonderful! There was plenty to do in the local area and Stuart gave us great advice.  The local shop is a bit pricey so stock up on basics before you arrive.  We're looking forward to visiting again soon and trying the wood burning sauna which we didn't have time to do this time. ",5
8628,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Lottie,Stuart's place in the welsh wilderness was wonderful.  The countryside nearby is stunning and it's only a half hour drive to national park.  We climbed up Cadair Idris on Stuart's recommendation - walkers said it's as impressive as Snowdon with half the tourists. Be prepared that the cabin is just that and you will need to bring some kitchen supplies if you want to make elaborate meals.  You also need to make friends with the beasties as you're in the wilds of Wales after all.  The bedroom is super comfy and the outdoor shower is much better than it sounds. Would love to come back.,4
8629,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Jason,"A friend and I stayed in Stuart's log cabins this week, whilst on a motorbike tour of Wales, and I honestly don't think I could have found a nicer place.  A warm greeting from Stuart as we rode down the lane set the scene, and we found him both engaging to chat to and eager to show us around.  He should is justly proud of what he has achieved - the location is stunning, and the peace and tranquillity it offers was well worth the wait.

Stuart has clearly enjoyed putting together the eclectic mix of cabins and ornamentation, which were fully equipped, warm, comfortable and wonderfully different.  The outdoor bathtub, with a seemingly endless supply of piping hot water, was something to experience.  A beer in the hand, and a view of the stars whilst soaking off the soreness of a day on the bike was a great way to relax.

The whole experience took me back to days of my youth where holidays were all about camping.  If you're expecting fine dining and polished brass bed knobs, stay somewhere else; if, however, you want an experience you'll be talking about for years to come, and want to stay somewhere where you'll be looking forward to going back to, then look no further.  We're already planning our next biking trip, and will be sure to stop in for another night at Stuart's cabins.",5
8630,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Claire,"Excellent location for exploring the area - walks from the front door. Stuart is an attentive and helpful host. The outside bath was brilliant - soaking in the sunshine overlooking the trees and stream can't be beaten for location. The shower, again outdoors, was hot and powerful.  The cooking facilities are basic but we managed to prepare meals with a bit of improvisation. It was great waking up to the view and to listen to the birdsong. ",4
8631,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Richard,"Stuart was a great and warm host who looked after our every need whilst we stayed in one of his log cabins.
 
Me and my uncle arrived in a electric car and found it almost impossible to commute around Wales running off electric power only because of a lack of electric charging stations. Stuart plugged us in to a mains on his property so we could put the car on a very slow charge and even dropped us off at the local hotel/bar a few miles away both nights we were there which really has amazing views of Lake Vyrnwy. 

Stuarts place overlooks a small valley within a huge valley which is very scenic. Just sitting looking over the view from the cabins you can see lots of wildlife about. The general area around his place is very impressive and very rural.

About his cabins. Very clean and very warm!  He has a full functional kitchen as well as a outside toilet, hot shower and bath.

Bath? Yes bath. Probably one of the best you will ever have. I find it amazing that the host didn't make this the central selling point of his property. It is amazing simply put. Imagine a deep hot filled bath on the edge of a valley looking up at the Milky Way? Well, it was cloudy the night I took a bath but it was still amazing!

The cabins seat 2 each generally. All are clean and very warm. My bed was very cosy as well. The nights I stayed dropped as low as -1C in June! I was warm all night!

A few things about Stuart. He is a little eccentric but a very clever and humble guy. If he reads this I will point out the skeletons with LED lights holding Whiskey bottles lining his drive or the 120+ VHS 80's movies on shelves in the cabin I stayed in available to watch. The outside bath (which is amazing) or his Wallaby's on his land running about. 

All in all such a great host who I cannot praise enough for introducing me to this very scenic and quiet part of Wales as well as being accommodating above and beyond. 

I am planning on running a photography weekend in the area soon and this will be the base for 6 of us. Rhiwargor Waterfall 7 miles away and Lake Vyrnwy 2 miles away are some of the best landscapes to see in the UK. 

5/5 will return again!

8640,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Tom,"Our weekend away was definitely one to remember! The walks are beautiful, the lake is incredible and to top it off Stuart's impressive handmade wooden cabin, kitchen, sauna, sky pod and out door bath are all amazing! 
After a day of walking through the fields and mountains taking in the scenery and maybe even renting a canoe on the lake which is ¬£15 for 1 hour and totally worth doing! Then imagine going back to Stuart's to enjoy a warm bath out side looking up at the stars just forgetting about everything and feeling complete relaxation. You truly do get the impression you're in a different country with the scenery and the wallabies hopping around in their pen (Stuart has three wallabies which was nice to go and see an animal id never seen before) 
Stuart himself is a fantastic host, always on hand to help you with anything you may need, living less than 100 yards away and his house and the cabins are separated by the car park and a small incline so you have complete privacy at all times when in the cabin and using the outside bath and shower. 

I'll end on, the pictures really do not do this place justice and you just have to go there to understand how awesome it really is! ",5

The cabin and adjoining kitchen were very clean, cozy and had everything we needed. The outdoor bath was an extremely well received addition after a long day of hiking.

8646,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Jenny,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Stuarts over Valentines weekend - and wow, what a weekend! Even before we arrived, Stuart made us feel right at home with his exceptional communication and by providing very helpful directions (without which we would have got even more lost!). As soon as we arrived in the surrounding area we knew we were in for a treat as even in cloudy February weather the views were beautiful. After arriving at Stuarts, we were given a tour of our accommodation and shown where everything was - the kitchen and bathroom are both very well kept and have all amenities advertised.

As for the cabin itself, we would have to agree with other reviewers, Stuarts pictures simply do not do them justice. We stayed in the bigger of the two rooms which was simply furnished with an amazing heater which kept the room super warm even in winter and two single beds (which were kindly pushed together) which had the most amazingly comfy duvet. The room also has a TV and VHS player which provides a nice vintage touch and allowed us to snuggle in bed watching some old classic videos which have also been provided. The cabin overlooks a view of a nice grassy area with a river and trees at the end of it and you could not ask for more peace and quiet if you tried. The outdoor bath adds a quirky touch and is a wonderful experience, as is the shower.

As for Stuart, he could not have been more friendly, attentive or lovely. He popped by to check how we were doing a couple of times a day yet gave us plenty of space to get on with our weekend. He is a very interesting person with a great story and it was lovely to get to know him over a few beers on the first evening. Will be coming back here in the summer to experience more the wonderful area has to offer and hopefully see the stars! Thank you for a great weekend, could not recommend more!",5

Stuart couldn't have been more hospitable, opening his home to us and taking us up to his local. Defo want to come back in the summer.",4
8649,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Amy,"We saw in the New Year at Stuarts place and we both agreed it was the most unique New Years celebration of our lives. We took the local bus, which dropped us a short walk from Stuarts house. The bus T82 only runs on a Wednesday from Oswestry. One of Stuart‚Äôs friends kindly picked us up and dropped us to his door. Stuart greeted us and showed us around. I think we said the word amazing about 100 times. The photos definitely do not do the place justice. The cabin overlooks a forest and a stream. There is an outdoor bath with views of the hills and the stream and if you get a clear night you can sit in a hot bath under the stars. Not to mention the wood-burning sauna, which is a truly delightful experience. We made full use of the kitchen facilities. If there was anything that we needed there was a shop not too far away. The cabins have heaters, which kept us really warm at all times. There are lots of classic and children‚Äôs VHS for guests to use. Stuart hand built ‚Äúsky pod‚Äù would be perfect for meal times. Next to the sky pod lives Stuart‚Äôs wallabies and his ducks. Stuart was so hospitable, very reliable and an absolute pleasure to get to know and spend time with.

The area is absolutely stunning; I'm not sure if the pictures quite do it justice. Stuart's cabin was lovely and cosy with everything we needed for our short stay.  He lit the sauna and opened a bottle of wine for us! I would recommend staying here 100%. ",5
8661,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Laura,"Stuart's place is such a find! A hidden gem close to Lake Vyrnwy and the gorgeous Rhiwargor Falls. We came for a wild swimming holiday and the wood fired Finnish sauna was such a treat in the evenings - as was eating dinner in the treetops surrounded by fairy lights in Stuart's beautiful sky pod construction. This is cosy camping style with an outdoor kitchen and a steaming hot shower under the stars. Stuart was a very friendly, generous, accommodating host and we enjoyed sharing a whiskey and some tales with him in the evening. Thanks Stuart! ",5
8662,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Fiona,"Stuart was a charming host, he warmly welcomed us and shared his knowledge on the local area and welcomed us on to his unique skypod - we enjoyed the warmth of the chimmychingo (fire) and the tranquil surrounding. We had a great stay at the cabin. The cabin has all the facilities listed, it was cosy and had everything we needed-it was perfect for us. Lovely walks around the area rivers and lakes. We miss sitting at the cabin having a wine and listening to the owl and the buzzard after a long day hiking. Quite nice being removed from modern day distractions as you get no phone signal. We hope to return. Fiona and Damian ",5
8663,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Victoria,"I had such a great time here. The log cabin is wonderful and snug (and warm at night) There's a nice seating area where you can sit out with a beer perhaps :) and look over the valley and river - which is a stunning view. 
Stuart was very warm and helpful and friendly - the perfect host. 

All in all, brilliant!",5
8664,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sukhdip,"the listing is exactly as described and as per pictures. extremely good value for money, very scenic, and we even got to test the Sauna out - worked like a dream!
Stuart lives nearby and was a very attentive host, and looked after us very well, with welcome cups of tea/coffee and helped with his local knowledge, drawing us a fun walking map to lake vrynwy nearby and giving us tips for our onward journey to snowdon.
be warned to ring in advance if you need directions, as phone reception is close to non-existent in the area.
i would love to visit again, and hope i get the chance to in the future!
definetly 5 star rating!",5
8665,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Abigail,My family and I had a wonderful time at Stuarts cabins. Stuart was a wonderful host along with his friends. The cabins themselves have everything that you would need and we enjoyed cooking breakfast in the morning. Beds are comfy and we were sorry to have not had time to use the sauna. Fantastic surroundings and views. Family friendly and both my sons loved every moment. Thank you ,5
8666,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Simon,"Stuart is a really friendly, interesting and knowledgeable bloke; he made us feel like one of the family!

The cabins are lovely - much nicer than the description. There are actually three - a double, a twin (bunks) and a single (adjacent to the sauna). There's electricity & simple heating, but bring waterproofs & warm stuff if you're coming out of season. They're set in a tranquil private valley with just Stuart's neighbouring house in sight. Great walks in the area, really helped by Stuart lending us a map - thanks, Stuart!

We had a lovely sauna, cooked a couple of great meals in the simple kitchen and enjoyed the outdoor shower.  The ThunderBox loo was cool & quirky. 
If you're the kind of people who are happy to rough it a bit and love something a bit different, then book in here (but leave space for us to return!)...

8667,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Claire,"This was our first airbnb  experience and it was wonderful. We loved every second of our stay at the cabins.   They are  beautifully made and had a lovely rustic feel to them. The place was really comfortable and snug. 

Stuart is a lovely guy who was really hospitable and welcoming from the moment we arrived.  He has lots of interesting stories to keep you entertained. He even took time out to show us the town and introduce us to some of his friends. 

We took our 6yr old and 2yr old daughters with us. They totally loved staying in the cabins and thought that it was a great adventure. 

Thank you Stuart for a lovely holiday and we will be definitely be visiting again x ",5

8669,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Grant,"What a fantastic holiday. If you want to visit a beautiful part of the country this is it. Peace, tranquility and stunningly beautiful. They say ""You are what you eat"".... Well Stuart who owns this place must settle down to a plate of ""Absolute Legend"" every morning for breakfast! He couldn't have done anything else to make our stay perfect. He is welcoming, warm and very kind hearted, the kids loved him and he went out of his way everyday to double check they were having fun and we had everything we needed... And more. If you go, light the Sauna it's amazing. We will be booking again for next year, can't wait. Also Stuarts friends that we met also made us feel very welcome.",5
8670,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Imogen,"I arranged for my parents to go and stay at Stuarts lovely log cabins through my airbnb account since my parents aren't so hot on technology. The communication between Stuart and I was great and he seemed very keen to stay in touch and make sure my parents knew where the turning off to his house was. 
Lucy (mother): Stewart was very welcoming on arrival, showing us around and we really enjoyed our stay.  Don't be alarmed by high tech scare tactics on the tiny track down to the idyllic cabins.  Look out for little birds and herons along the stream.  Thank you Stewart for your hospitality, sharing your interesting history and being so helpful!",5
