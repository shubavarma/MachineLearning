964,Budget private room with ensuite - city centre," Flats for Rent in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom ",Dromor,David,so the location is fantastic  very close to train station and city centre  room was clean and very modern  it was quiet too   two things should be stated however  there is no internet  they say you can get city wifi  but that s a bit misleading  it s blatantly out of range  so i think they should represent that a bit clearer   second is that the kitchen is not really a kitchen  it s more of a closet with a compact refrigerator and microwave shared by the whole building  and they don t have enough cutlery  only knives   and not enough dish soap  and i requested more  and they said they d restock it but never did   so don t count on any cooking or internet  apart from that  it s a great price for the location  just plan to use data and eat microwave meals   ps  checkin was smooth  but you can t take a key  it s chained to the lock box  it made things a little inconvenient  but was still doable ,3
965,Budget private room with ensuite - city centre," Flats for Rent in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom ",Dromor,Jesse,fine for a couple days  a bit bare bone   the bed was not very comfortable  and the pillows were extremely flat  can be quite loud at night as walls are thin  good location to city center ,3
966,Budget private room with ensuite - city centre," Flats for Rent in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom ",Dromor,Liam,exactly what i feared from this kind of company owned place  completely impersonal  the place was filthy  and while they said the city had public wifi  i never got the slightest signal  and in that price range how hard is it to get a router  perfectly fine to spend a night in in a fix  not much good to say beyond that ,3
967,Budget private room with ensuite - city centre," Flats for Rent in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom ",Dromor,Kristin,we had to pay for parking at john lewis center which cost 1  pounds and the host did not refund  i mention this because in description host mentioned  parking at the train station  but employees stated we could not stay overnight  loud near industrial area  bathroom sink had draining issue  1 mini fridge for potentially   rooms booked at same time ,2

969,Budget private room with ensuite - city centre," Flats for Rent in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom ",Dromor,Kevin,the airbnb was what it says it is  but definitely not above and beyond in any regards  i won t nitpick here but the one thing i think needs to be mentioned is that wifi was not only not available  the free public wifi mentioned is less than off and on   the nearest place you ll find it is in the downtown area several minutes walk away  so if you need wifi in your room this probably isn t the airbnb option for you  if you need a decent place to stay and plan on being out all day while you re in cardiff  then it s just fine  cheers  ,4

1659,Double Room in Kilburn 15 Mins to City London 1A1," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Nishma,Lisa,the room looks exactly like it does in the pictures  the kitchen was very well equipped and we found the room to be super clean  kilburn isn t the nicest area of london  but the underground station was close to the airbnb and from there it was a quick ride to the city center  it was quite noisy because the room faces the street  however we had no problems sleeping at night  there s a supermarket right across the street which was great for us  since the other rooms were also occupied during our stay  the bathroom was quite dirty when we arrived  however  it was cleaned shortly after which we really appreaciated  i wouldn t recommend the room for a romantic getaway  simply because the area isn t great and the room isn t laid out for that  but it was great for me and my friend  nishma was great at communicating check in and check out details  the whole system is quite high tech  but actually very convenient ,4
1660,Double Room in Kilburn 15 Mins to City London 1A1," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Nishma,Graeme,it s great value for the location  the only thing to bear in mind is that you are one of three bedrooms being let through airbnb at the same time  so the quality of your experience will be influenced by how the other guests treat the property whilst you are there    i would stay again ,3

1666,Double Room in Kilburn 15 Mins to City London 1A1," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Nishma,Mary,nishma s place was the perfect place to spend the last few days of our month long back packing trip  while a little farther out from the main city  it is only a train ride away to all the main stations after about a 10 minute walk  two of the rooms do face the street  so bringing earplugs may be a good idea just to block out some of the traffic  nishma was incredibly quick at responding and ensuring that we had the best time while we were there ,5

2167,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Anna,extremely overpriced for what it is  it s marketed as a   star hotel but doesn t offer the same level of service you expect from a   star hotel   serviced apartment  the staff give off a disinterested vibe and whilst contactable and responsive when called upon  there s no extra care given  often felt like i was an inconvenience even though i had paid full freight up front ,3

2181,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,David,i picked this place based on the good reviews  but my experience was quite different  when i first arrived  i discovered that the light at the doorway inside the room could not be switched off  which affected my sleep  i raised this with reception the next day  but nothing was done about it for several days  it was only fixed when i raised this yet again  which was one week into my stay  after the fix  there was some debris left on the floor  which would have been cleaned up by anyone attentive enough  i d soon discover that this sort of tardy and incomplete service would be characteristic of this place  when i checked in  i was told that housekeeping would be done for me every sunday   this was not done until two and a half weeks into my stay  when i wanted my bins emptied  that took a few days as well   and even then  they missed one of the bins  when housekeeping finally came  they missed out on the bins yet again  rarely are things done to complete satisfaction in this place  it was really tiring to have to hound the receptionists for these basic services  especially after a long day of work  after two weeks  i had enough and i wanted to relocate and get a refund  however  they weren t helpful on this front at all   instead of working together with me to find a compromise  they simply pointed to the no refund clause on the airbnb site and directed me to contact airbnb s agents myself  i m not sure why it fell upon me to remedy their unsatisfactory service  but at this point it didn t surprise me to receive such a response   i suppose that most of the previous reviewers must have only stayed for shorter periods  and so such flaws are less evident  for travelers looking for longer stays  i would recommend that you look elsewhere ,3

2190,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Alex,i booked this place for my stay in london because of its excellent location  i was first given a room on the 1 th floor but due to a broken ac  i was later moved to the  th floor  generally speaking  the room was tidy and everything looked good  i did think that the rooms were a bit too dark for my liking and the light control was all over the place  it would also help if the ac control was closer to the bed because when it got too cold  you had to get up and walk into the living room to change the temperature but this is a minor thing  overall  the staff was very helpful and they even let me check in ahead of the official time so that was nice ,4

2595,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Jonny,i stayed at leman locke in order to isolate for three days prior to an operation as advised by the hospital during the coronavirus pandemic  the place itself was the perfect location and would be great for any visitors who are able to venture out to the nearby restaurants amd bars  however  as a guest who was staying in the room for the bulk of my stay  it lacked the required functionality i would have hoped for at that price  the main issue was the fact that the extractor fan was broken and as you are unable to open any windows in the apartment  it tended to smell of whatever you had cooked until it was time to cook another meal  resulting in a rather grim aroma  the microwave was also broken  meaning everything had to be made on the hob  contributing further to the smell  some more minor negatives i came across were that the smart apps on the tv also didn t work  google said a factory reset or update was needed for the tv   and there was a permanently flashing light in the bathroom ceiling  making showering feel like you were at an edm festival  the pillows could also do with some softening up  it s a shame as the apartment itself is very nice and beautifully furnished  but it let itself down on the more practical aspects and for that reason i don t think i would return  having said that  if you just plan to use it as a place to crash after long days out i would say it s perfect ,2
2596,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Amanuel,had a great weekend stay at leman locke  the place was stylish in decor yet comfy  it s also super close to aldgate station which was convenient  i ll definitely stay again ,5

2729,Designer Studio Apartment in Central London," Flats for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Leman Locke,Tasmia,stunning  the airbnb was exactly as shown in the pictures and even more perfect in person   i was here for   nights  and right from the check in to check out  the staff were so friendly  on board and extremely welcoming  the room itself had everything that you needed  all the fine details taken care of and the staff were on hand for your beck and call   it for sure made you feel like home   the interior of leman locke but inside the actual apartment was also amazing and obvious that a lot of thought had gone into it  the only con i would list is the location  for someone travelling from the west midlands  the bnb wasn t the easiest to find and the nearest affordable car park was a 1  minute walk which isn t far but isn t ideal when you re carrying luggage which again isn t the fault of leman locke but overall  loved the place and will definitely be staying again ,4

3094,Private double room with en suite facilities," Hotels for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Kip,Jayne,actual stay was fine but no answers to messages requesting extending stay by 1 night and on morning we left all the exterior doors jammed so we couldn t leave the building via the lift and had to make about   journeys up and down fire stairs with band equipment to leave the hotel not a great end to the weekend  but we ve stayed before  it was right next to where our event was so would probably stay again ,4

3124,Private double room with en suite facilities," Hotels for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Kip,Kymberly,overall a good and comfortable stay  nice decor and minimalistic   when you check in they give you coffee tokens to bring down in the morning for a free coffee which is a nice touch    whilst the room was nice it was definitely on the more simple side  although you get coffee tokens  there s no kettle in the room so you can only have one coffee a day in the room  there s also no iron or hairdryer in the room which if you re travelling light may be an issue   the room was lovely but could have done with a fresh coat of paint and updating in the bathroom as the sink cabinet was rusty and had bits of metal sticking out    there is an overground right behind the hotel which is ideal for getting around    the room had air con and heating  and the tv had netflix which was a lovely touch compared to normal tv channels in hotels    would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to explore london ,3
3125,Private double room with en suite facilities," Hotels for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Kip,Ryan,not a bad stay by any means but the room is alot smaller than seen in the pictures  also  the air conditioning unit in our room was broken and it flashed lights during the night which wasn t ideal when trying to sleep  another slight inconvenience was loud noise coming from the hallway during the early hours  final note  the bathroom door within the room would be better as an actual door rather than a slider as it didn t seem to close fully ,3

3495,Private double room with en suite facilities," Hotels for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Kip,Nadine,good for 1 or   night stay when you just need somewhere to crash   stayed for   nights for a wedding  very small room  very basic  we were right by the train tracks which didn t bother us  but a public footpath too which was busy  that was annoying  however earplugs were provided   one thin pillow provided  small double bed  no sockets by the mirrors so was difficult to get ready   basically a monochrome travelodge with free proper coffee  which was lovely   staff were also very friendly ,3

3500,Private double room with en suite facilities," Hotels for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Kip,Lily,the location of this hotel is amazing  especially paying the air bnb rate  i had a room with a window which was great  but the slight downside is the noise outside  however  with the earplugs i slept really well and you would get street and train noise at any location like this  i would say the shower was a bit annoying  kept going hot and cold and never stayed at a regular temperature  apart from that  everything was great  you can also ask for a hairdryer at reception which was very useful ,5
3501,Private double room with en suite facilities," Hotels for Rent in Greater London, England, United Kingdom ",Kip,Kit,close to the station  nicedesign  but the room is slightly smaller than expected  all good in general   ,4

4094,Cove Minshull Street One Bedroom Apartment," Flats for Rent in Manchester, ., United Kingdom ",Cove Minshull Street,Francesca,our apartment at cove was clean  comfortable  and in a great location   communication was not great  i sent the host a message via airbnb several hours before arriving to ask if it was okay to change our check in time  i never received a reply  not even after the fact   there were also issues with the accuracy of the listing  while i understood that because we were booking at an aparthotel  each room might differ slightly  but i expected that the amenities would be the same in each room  a large part of the reason that we chose to stay at cove was because we wanted a bathtub  as is shown in the photos  however  we arrived and stayed the first night in a room without a bathtub  ideally  each type of room should have a separate listing  at the very least  the listing should contain a disclaimer about room variety   after our first night we asked reception if we could be moved to a room with a bathtub  michelle was incredibly kind and helpful in moving us to a new room  and even sent us a text to let us know when it was ready    overall  the apartment itself was nice and reception was very friendly and helpful  however  this is an example of the issues that can arise when a company  rather than an individual  advertises on airbnb ,4

4202,Cove Minshull Street One Bedroom Apartment," Flats for Rent in Manchester, ., United Kingdom ",Cove Minshull Street,Ben,don t fully believe in the pictures  the building interior is very much like a student dormitory  the room you are assigned to will greatly impact how your flat will look like  i got the one at the end of the hallway  and it had a narrow corridor with small windows  but it s alright since i only used it to sleep and i was out the entire day  the cleanliness was great though  the bathroom didn t have an exhaust fan which was strange   i travelled with another person and they used the bedroom while i used the couch  the couch was really small which won t be comfortable at all if you are taller than   1    the location is spectacular as it is only 10 1  minute walk from the christmas markets  main shopping areas  museums  china town  and pretty much all the main tourist locations  it s location is hidden in a street that is really quiet  i would recommend going home earlier at night as there are a lot of suspicious looking people hanging around the square close to the apartment ,4

4419,Cove Minshull Street One Bedroom Apartment," Flats for Rent in Manchester, ., United Kingdom ",Cove Minshull Street,Eva,impressively clean apartment with all the basic amenities needed for cooking and washing your clothes  we only stayed for a long weekend so did not use the kitchen very much  but would be fantastic for a longer stay    the check in process was really fast and there were always people on the front desk  more like a hotel than an air b b   my partner uses a walking aid so the lifts were greatly appreciated   they also let us keep our luggage behind the desk after checkout  as our train was in the evening  which was really helpful  great location and only   minutes from the station    it is moderately expensive  but that s what you expect from the location  it was quite noisy at night  but again  that is due to the location at weekend  not a complaint  but something to consider if travelling with children    there are two tv s   one in the bedroom and one in the main living area  these are not smart tv s  so bring your own laptop if you want to want to watch streaming services such as netflix   overall  we were really happy with our stay here and would come back again ,5

4431,Cove Minshull Street One Bedroom Apartment," Flats for Rent in Manchester, ., United Kingdom ",Cove Minshull Street,Verity,the location of the building is spot on    mins walk from the central piccadilly station and a stone s throw from the city centre including the nq  market street  etc  the front desk staff are really friendly and helpful and are on hand pretty much all day and night  the room is quite basic but does what it needs to do  that said  what we paid for the room    nights  i think was quite over estimated  the on site gym is also very basic and small  i was hoping to make use of the facility often during the week but it was continually occupied  we also requested a room clean half way through the stay  and although the team changed our sheets and emptied the bins  they didn t really do much else  not sure if i d stay again but if anyone is traveling and working remotely or on a business trip then cove would do nicely ,3

4892,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Caroline,due to horrendous weather conditions  our stay was very cold wet and damp  we left early as we couldn t take it any more  there was inadequate heating in the tree house and none in the sky pod which limited space for our family of    what was supposed to be a happy  0th birthday celebration turned out to be a disaster  ideal in summer when weather is better but not in winter  we were limited for cooking as there is no oven  nowhere to sit and eat together as the benches are outside  no locks on doors which made us feel vulnerable when going out and about for security  on the plus side  the bath with a view was nice and stuart  the host cannot do enough for you  the heating issues need sorting if you are visiting during the winter months  wi fi is provided  make sure you ask otherwise you wont get it ,2

4895,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sasha,this is a hard review to write because we loved our trip and definitely made the most of the place but it has lots of things that need to be mentioned to future prospective guests   firstly  our visit was in january  so of course it was freezing  but there s only heating in the bedroom  which is good heating from a small machine and very welcome   so the kitchen is cold  the bathroom is cold  and the top of the skypod was completely unusable due to the cold and lack of heating  we didn t use the bunk bed room or the treehouse room   secondly  the cleanliness is practically non existent  there are webs and dirt everywhere  the fridge hadn t been cleaned and absolutely reeked so we just kept our food outside  we had to rewash the dishes before using them and the dishcloths were dirty   thirdly  the huts and outside bath are more in view of stuart s property than we were lead to believe  however with our car parked in between we got a little more privacy   both baths are completely open which was our favourite part of the place  the stargazing is incredible and the hot water is very good and stayed hot   the sauna was good  we paid for the wood which we helped stuart get out ourselves   the location is great for access to loads of incredible sites and waterfalls  only a short drive away  there s only one shop in the area which is a petrol station  a takeaway and a small grocery  there s absolutely no service around the area and no wifi at the property  which was listed so we knew what we were in for    great for escapism but tricky at times   a couple really strange things i have to note are the weird halloween decorations in january  the duck chained to the bath was very odd  a severed hand and warning signs all down the entrance path        and oddest of all was a review of the place framed in the bathroom that was the world s worst review so comical i had to take a photo in disbelief  it s the only review displayed in the place and an a  side explaining how much they hated the place  very very confusing   despite all this we did have a good trip with lots of memories after we got used to the oddities of the huts ,3

4932,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Gail,did a last minute booking and it was great value for money given we had the entire space to ourselves  we visit the lake every season and stay somewhere different and local every time  stuart s is very local indeed accessed down a tarmac road then down a track  not overly steep and more than doable in a car  instructions to it are very clear and easy to find   we stayed in the double room net to the  thunder box  and near the outdoor seating  this room had a little balcony and a kitchen next door which was adequate for us as we generally eat out anyway  had a indoor outdoor shower which has the facing wall removed so you have uninterrupted views of the trees below and you can hear the river as you bathe  loved the fact its river water heated up and don t be put off bu the colour  felt very refreshed and clean when got out    we were going to use the sauna but never got round to it  stuart kindly lit the fire for us with his slow torch saving me building and getting the fire going as was lit and well underway within minutes  we took kindling and wood as we were not sure if there would be wood available  stuart has lots of tea lights for use too    as we are of a certain age  it was fun listening to the hiss ion a vhs video again and seeing classic films from our youth  nice retro feel  sockets by the bed have a usb charger outlet included so can charge phones albeit you have to get above higher ground to get a signal but that is notoriously difficult in the area generally  you can pop to artisan s cafe and use their free wi fi  make sure you take your essentials with you tea coffee milk and the local shop shuts early so its not a quick trip for milk  maybe stuart could include a point in the fridge to get a brew incase you forget   if you expect a hotel style sanitised environment then this is not for you  no matter how clean in such a natural surroundings you are going to get spider webs etc  to expect not too is unrealistic  the room was clean  smelt fresh  bedding was clean  bed was fine  kitchen was clean and easy to use  had to wash out the bath and would expect to given one is outside in the elements and the other has   walls  but this is not an issue as i said its located in natural surroundings  this is a great place for children too as space for games and critter spotting  the black skies are amazing and as we had aa clear night fab views of stars  it felt remote although it really isn t the village is a mile away  it felt  off the grid  and this added to ensuring a relaxed  leave it all behind you  stay  we loved our brief stay and especially hamish the   legged girl cat who is adorable and friendly and a huntress as she sat guarding our room and keeping an eye out for critters  you have nothing to lose by trying something different and a lot to gain by going with the flow and chilling out ,5

5117,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kate,beautiful setting and quirky cabins  but hygiene was not up to standard  the bed had been changed but the surfaces in the cabin and kitchen and the fridge had not been cleaned   had old bits of food in fridge and kitchen surfaces  dust and grime on cabin surfaces  crumbs on chair in cabin etc  we couldn t bring ourselves to stay one night because we had our baby  which we had been allowed to book with an infant  but we did not feel the hygiene and the draughty main cabin door was safe for a baby to sleep in or prepare food for in the kitchen  if i had been paying camping prices i would not have minded  but this was alot more expensive and in my opinion  not worth it for the state it is currently in  as it has been left unloved and unclean ,2

5257,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Lucy,stuart s place exceeded my expectations  the location was absolutely stunning and the cabins were perfect for our trip  the river is a lot closer than we expected which was fantastic and the bath tub was incredible  as expected the place does get cold without the heater on and there are cobwebs and spiders in the kitchen and toilet  what do you expect from an outdoor cabin  but all the facilities are really clean and well looked after and the heaters and water gets really really hot  stuart was a great host and looked after us really well  the hill is steeper than the pictures show so may not be suitable for toddlers but the pictures for everything else does not do this place enough justice  if you stay here i d absolutely recommend driving around the river and stopping off to do the walk to the waterfalls  cannot wait to return   ,5

5268,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Shaunie,unfortunately we arrived a little later than expected due to my partners late finish from his shift as a paramedic  we were greeted with sarcasm and disappointment as stuart had put a fire up for us but sadly had gone out before we arrived  we only stayed for a small amount of time before leaving again  the only reason we left was purely because of the lack of cleanliness and hygiene  we are from the countryside so we understand a few spider and webs but this was a unkempt infestation  with false widow spiders  not only this but the kitchen was beyond filthy  tea stains  grease on cutlery  rancid food in bottom of fridge  the floor looked like it had not even been swept or clean as bottle caps were scattered all over the floor  the linen looked old and due the filthy setting  did not feel confident that they had even been cleaned  stuart s house over looks the entire log cabin area and is very close on site which disappointed us as we believed it was private and  secluded  we felt misled by the lack of information and photographs provided  also beware the narrow lane leading to the accommodation as it is very unsuitable for road vehicles we scraped and scratched the bottom of the car driving up and down it  we were so disappointed as the cabins were in a perfect setting and it was such a shame that they were not and probably not ever kept clean for clients paying to stay in them ,1

5294,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rob,stuart s cabins are beautifully situated  we loved the bath and the setting  however    my main gripe is that the place was not clean  in fact  i would describe it as absolutely filthy  i do not have particularly high standards and we had expected cobwebs and a bit of muck  but this was simply something else  none of the floors had been swept and all the sheds had grass and muck all over the floors  the kitchen was simply filthy with a cooker with someone else s food still all over it and a fridge with crumbs and sticky stuff on the shelves  the pans had been washed up but had food debris on them and the cutlery was covered in grease  the tables were sticky  the cutlery tray was simply disgusting  even the kettle was horrible  we went out the second day and bought some cheap stuff to cook and eat with  in one bedroom and the treehouse the basins looked as if they had not been cleaned for months   this was truly foul  one bed had a plate of congealed food under and another a crisp packet  the treehouse had a bin full of rubbish and everything in it was covered in grime  i had planned to let my children sleep in here and they were disappointed that i stopped them  all the bed linen was old and not properly clean and in one cabin the bed really damp  the really disconcerting thing was that when stuart arrived with an effusive welcome he seemed genuinely taken aback that we found the place unacceptable  he was genial and friendly but did not apologise or offer to clean the place properly  he even commented to another of our party  my elderly mother  that i was  a right barrel of laughs   which i thought very rude considering i had been extremely polite to him despite being bitterly disappointed with the place  i should point out that my mother was herself so upset with the grim state that she offered to pay for us to go to a hotel  but was too polite to say anything to stuart herself  on the second day my eldest     woke and sat up in the top bunk to find herself covered in cobwebs  and this was not just a tiny one in a corner   this was months of no cleaning   my   year old lost her bedsock under the bottom bunk and came out covered in dust and grime and cried  this was just horrible  my own shed was no better  could stuart maybe clean the windows once in a while  this was like the inside of a garden shed after some years of spiders and dirt  if you now wonder whether i may just be a complaining  cleanliness obsessed idiot then please get in touch and i will send you some photos  we live in an old and crumbly house in a very rural area and are used to basic facilities and a lack of modern   ,2

5358,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kevin,be warned this is very basic accommodation  we went  for a long weekend in november from thursday night to sunday  however we left saturday morning as description not accurate  stuart the host is very amiable and very helpful always checking to see if your ok  the views are stunning  those are the good points  these are not log cabins they are large sheds  there is no living space so you are confined to your bed i know we went in november but the convector heater in the main shed is not adequate unless you have multiple layers on   no heating in kitchen so eating in there was not possible and if more then   of you there is no room  outside shower is no more then an area between the   sheds with a shower door put on and you stand on a concrete slab after you clear all the leaves and muck away  sauna and outside bbq were not used as they needed a quite a fierce heat to get them started  a small point is that all rooms have tv s but there is no signal so you have vhs videos to watch  woke up on saturday morning to no hot water  which was the last straw so we left  this is not a reflection on stuart  just the accommodation  ,2
5359,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Natalie,brilliant experience although the weather wasn t on our side  rained solid   so didn t manage to make the most of what was on offer in the cabins bath  shower  treehouse  however stuart was a brilliant host making us feel welcome and welcomed us in his home congratulating us on our engagement   beautiful area and views    such a quirky place to stay  brilliant imagination put into this accommodation   we can t wait to have a trip back to stuart s next summer    ,5
5360,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Corinna,we stayed one night at the cabin  if your looking for something out of a hoseasons catalogue  then this is not for you   however if your looking for a beautiful cabin  with plenty of space to share with your nearest and dearest or just get away from it all  with its beautiful rustic charm then this is the place for you  from everything from the wood burung sauna  up cycled firepit  to the outdoor bath  the whole place leaves you feeling completely relaxed  it is set in beautiful surroundings and during our stay we were lucky enough to use the outside bath  starring up into the clear night sky and see   shooting stars   stuart was a great host and had time to come and chat with us and he couldn t be more helpful  bottom line is we will be returning for more than 1 night next time  one thing i would say is make sure you go in suitable transport  as a lowered sports car  isn t the most practical mode of transport down the track to stuart s place  ,5

5425,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Nath,fantastic experience  stuart has built three cabins  which was perfect for our group of five  the whole set up is really unique  at the top of a valley with a river running nearby and a whole lot of peace and quiet    we stayed over new years  so it was a bit cold out  however we were able to warm up with the heaters in the cabin  and with the homemade sauna and bath tub  all great features    one area for improvement in heating terms is that the second cabin  with the bunk beds  was a bit colder than the other two cabins  meaning we ended up having four to a double bed in the warmer room  this was fine for us  but could be improved in the future for other winter guests  wouldn t be a problem in summer    would highly recommend the experience if you re looking for a peaceful retreat in nature  ,5

6323,Garden refuge in style," Tiny houses for Rent in Naunton, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom ",Dolly,Caitlin,the space was magical   the kind of thing you d have love to have in your backyard as a kid  i found google maps to be perfectly accurate with directions  the locations was great for visiting many villages  however i didn t find it close enough to a town to be able to walk to a pub on my own  some reviews mentioned lack of privacy not being as secluded as the picture suggests   they aren t wrong but i personally never interacted with the family or pets during my stay so it was the distance yet safety i was looking for as a solo traveler  the last thing i will add is that there are lots of birds around which is lovely but if you re a light sleeper they may wake you up landing on the roof frequently  overall  would recommend for a short stay to disconnect from busy day to day life ,5

6602,Garden refuge in style," Tiny houses for Rent in Naunton, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom ",Dolly,Joan,the description of the airbnb is accurate but it might be helpful to note the following    the mobile reception is not the best in the area but there is no wifi in the room   the top windows of the refuge doesn t have blinds so if you don t mind the sun waking you up  it s ok   there are alot of animal noises all day and night  so you need to be ok sleeping with such noises   the room is quite small for two person   there are steps behind the parking area that is much easier to access than going around the pond but there were no signs so it wasn t obvious when we first arrived,4

6620,Garden refuge in style," Tiny houses for Rent in Naunton, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom ",Dolly,Stephanie,we came here because the reviews were so good but unfortunately we didn t have a positive experience like other guests did  and we feel let down by some of the false details in the listing    firstly  we had issues with the toilet  a leak on the floor to begin with which wasn t a big deal but the toilet later made a constant loud trickling noise  and then we had to deal with the plumber in the morning before checking out   few hours of our stay spoilt as a result    it is a working farm  so do expect noise from animals  etc  however  the host s dogs were barking in the early hours of the morning which disrupted our sleep after already having to put up with noise from the toilet  we appreciate that the listing mentions about potential noise  but you don t expect to be woken in the early hours when you re away on a break that is advertised as  calm and romantic    unfortunately  after a disturbed evening and sleep  we were then woken at 0     by the guineafawl  this usually wouldn t bother us  but given the previous disturbances we were fed up by this point     the listing states that the host s response time is within an hour and that the host has 100  response rate   neither are accurate  we did not always receive a reply within the hour  sometimes several hours late   we also received no prior details about check in from the host  as we have done with all other airbnb properties we ve stayed in  and did not receive a response at all  let alone within an hour  when we enquired about entry to the accommodation before we arrived  therefore  we felt a bit awkward by just guessing that it was okay to let ourselves in with no specific instructions  we managed to gain entrance okay  but we just found it a bit lazy that there was no effort by the host to send even a generic message in advance about entry    regarding the response rate time  of course people work have other commitments which makes replying difficult  we get that  but it s not fair to deceive potential guests who are paying a lot of money for a service that is advertised but actually can t be offered  just simply be honest in the listing  another example is the chauffeur service advertised   we ve encountered difficulties getting taxis in the cotswolds before  so thought this was an attractive service on offer  we enquired about it at about  pm  thinking we d get a response within the hour  as advertised  and didn t get a response until after 10pm when it was too late  we ended up driving ourselves to the pub and back  whether this inaccurate listing information is a fault on the host s part or airbnb s part  we do not know  but it doesn t give us much faith in booking accommodation with airbnb moving forward    we imagine it s natural for a lot of people to want to highlight the bad things first when feeling so let down by spending  1   in total for a one night stay that was far from  calm and romantic   in our case   however  it would be unfair not to mention the positives   the accommodation was clean and tastefully decorated  the land itself was very charming  and dolly s mother was lovely when we spoke to her on a couple of occasions  the dogs barked at us upon arrival but then soon got used to us and were rather friendly  hanging around and sitting outside the accommodation with us  the accommodation is also very well located  with lots of popular places in the cotswolds only a short drive away  we ate at a local pub called the hollow bottom in guiting power and had a nice meal  the staff were also lovely there   on the whole  this place has great potential but we just had an unfortunate experience and  hindsight being a wonderful thing  wish we d have stayed elsewhere ,3

8076,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Sasha,this is a hard review to write because we loved our trip and definitely made the most of the place but it has lots of things that need to be mentioned to future prospective guests   firstly  our visit was in january  so of course it was freezing  but there s only heating in the bedroom  which is good heating from a small machine and very welcome   so the kitchen is cold  the bathroom is cold  and the top of the skypod was completely unusable due to the cold and lack of heating  we didn t use the bunk bed room or the treehouse room   secondly  the cleanliness is practically non existent  there are webs and dirt everywhere  the fridge hadn t been cleaned and absolutely reeked so we just kept our food outside  we had to rewash the dishes before using them and the dishcloths were dirty   thirdly  the huts and outside bath are more in view of stuart s property than we were lead to believe  however with our car parked in between we got a little more privacy   both baths are completely open which was our favourite part of the place  the stargazing is incredible and the hot water is very good and stayed hot   the sauna was good  we paid for the wood which we helped stuart get out ourselves   the location is great for access to loads of incredible sites and waterfalls  only a short drive away  there s only one shop in the area which is a petrol station  a takeaway and a small grocery  there s absolutely no service around the area and no wifi at the property  which was listed so we knew what we were in for    great for escapism but tricky at times   a couple really strange things i have to note are the weird halloween decorations in january  the duck chained to the bath was very odd  a severed hand and warning signs all down the entrance path        and oddest of all was a review of the place framed in the bathroom that was the world s worst review so comical i had to take a photo in disbelief  it s the only review displayed in the place and an a  side explaining how much they hated the place  very very confusing   despite all this we did have a good trip with lots of memories after we got used to the oddities of the huts ,3

8099,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,A,pros  1  warm and welcoming host     excellent location  although you must read host s instructions to reach the place  perfect for walking trips  beautiful lake and waterfall trek nearby      lots of quirks and special additions  eg  massive range of movies  treehouse  sauna   x open bath tubs  instant hot running water  basic amenities  secluded enough  running river close by    cons  1  the place lacked a basic level of cleanliness  the remainder of people s meals in the microwave  grease around the stove  filty hand basins  unswept patios  that said  the toilet bowls were clean and the rooms were tidy     the place comes up as     night on airbnb  which is a little misleading  because as soon as you add an adult it goes up by   0 night and then there s another  10 airbnb charge     there was a mention of a sauna  but no mention of extra cost for wood  except for in the reviews  reviews said    extra for wood  we were charged    extra  due to wood prices going up  ,4

8103,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Jordan,i had a nice stay here with my friends after hiking snowdon on the weekend  it was pretty well equipped with cooking and bbq utensils  lots of old tvs and huge movie selection  and few board games  you could buy a large bucket of wood for a    which would last you a night  and he offered to rent us some of his bikes if that s what you re into  didn t have any signal on vodaphone but ee seemed to have some service  there was heaters in the bedrooms although the construction of the cabins weren t insulated  the tree house bedroom was too cold for us to sleep in october  clean towels and linen so no complaints there   the tree house was was quite close to the owners house and the entire airbnb area wasnt very secluded so might not be the best choice for a romantic holiday  i stayed with a few mates so we didn t have an issue with that  the outside bath was in complete view through the window of his house so i wouldn t want to be in the nude  we really enjoyed the bathtub and toilet overlooking the forest though  it would have been nice if there was some hedge or a fence to give the place a bit more privacy  i ve found this the case with allot of airbnb cabins i ve stayed in that they are not very secluded from the owner s house  the suana room was locked and wasn t mentioned upon arrival  i remembered there was supposed to be a suana on the second day and stuart explained that he had some guests previously that made a mess with essential oils or something so if you want to use the suana you need to ask stuart to come down to unlock the room  light the fire and explain how to use the suana properly  bit of a shame as i would have preferred to have been explained and have access to the suana upon arrival  it would be nice to have a suana at 1  o clock at night without having to go through the entire process  you might want to bring your own drinking water as the tap water he said wasn t for drinking  there was drinking water provided in a large plastic container which tasted clean to me but not sure of its source and how long its been sitting there  sure its fine though  enjoyed the stars and fire pit at night  and the fairy lights and candles were a nice touch  good value and a nice  alternative to camping  thanks for having us ,3

8113,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Gail,did a last minute booking and it was great value for money given we had the entire space to ourselves  we visit the lake every season and stay somewhere different and local every time  stuart s is very local indeed accessed down a tarmac road then down a track  not overly steep and more than doable in a car  instructions to it are very clear and easy to find   we stayed in the double room net to the  thunder box  and near the outdoor seating  this room had a little balcony and a kitchen next door which was adequate for us as we generally eat out anyway  had a indoor outdoor shower which has the facing wall removed so you have uninterrupted views of the trees below and you can hear the river as you bathe  loved the fact its river water heated up and don t be put off bu the colour  felt very refreshed and clean when got out    we were going to use the sauna but never got round to it  stuart kindly lit the fire for us with his slow torch saving me building and getting the fire going as was lit and well underway within minutes  we took kindling and wood as we were not sure if there would be wood available  stuart has lots of tea lights for use too    as we are of a certain age  it was fun listening to the hiss ion a vhs video again and seeing classic films from our youth  nice retro feel  sockets by the bed have a usb charger outlet included so can charge phones albeit you have to get above higher ground to get a signal but that is notoriously difficult in the area generally  you can pop to artisan s cafe and use their free wi fi  make sure you take your essentials with you tea coffee milk and the local shop shuts early so its not a quick trip for milk  maybe stuart could include a point in the fridge to get a brew incase you forget   if you expect a hotel style sanitised environment then this is not for you  no matter how clean in such a natural surroundings you are going to get spider webs etc  to expect not too is unrealistic  the room was clean  smelt fresh  bedding was clean  bed was fine  kitchen was clean and easy to use  had to wash out the bath and would expect to given one is outside in the elements and the other has   walls  but this is not an issue as i said its located in natural surroundings  this is a great place for children too as space for games and critter spotting  the black skies are amazing and as we had aa clear night fab views of stars  it felt remote although it really isn t the village is a mile away  it felt  off the grid  and this added to ensuring a relaxed  leave it all behind you  stay  we loved our brief stay and especially hamish the   legged girl cat who is adorable and friendly and a huntress as she sat guarding our room and keeping an eye out for critters  you have nothing to lose by trying something different and a lot to gain by going with the flow and chilling out ,5

8475,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Rob,stuart s cabins are beautifully situated  we loved the bath and the setting  however    my main gripe is that the place was not clean  in fact  i would describe it as absolutely filthy  i do not have particularly high standards and we had expected cobwebs and a bit of muck  but this was simply something else  none of the floors had been swept and all the sheds had grass and muck all over the floors  the kitchen was simply filthy with a cooker with someone else s food still all over it and a fridge with crumbs and sticky stuff on the shelves  the pans had been washed up but had food debris on them and the cutlery was covered in grease  the tables were sticky  the cutlery tray was simply disgusting  even the kettle was horrible  we went out the second day and bought some cheap stuff to cook and eat with  in one bedroom and the treehouse the basins looked as if they had not been cleaned for months   this was truly foul  one bed had a plate of congealed food under and another a crisp packet  the treehouse had a bin full of rubbish and everything in it was covered in grime  i had planned to let my children sleep in here and they were disappointed that i stopped them  all the bed linen was old and not properly clean and in one cabin the bed really damp  the really disconcerting thing was that when stuart arrived with an effusive welcome he seemed genuinely taken aback that we found the place unacceptable  he was genial and friendly but did not apologise or offer to clean the place properly  he even commented to another of our party  my elderly mother  that i was  a right barrel of laughs   which i thought very rude considering i had been extremely polite to him despite being bitterly disappointed with the place  i should point out that my mother was herself so upset with the grim state that she offered to pay for us to go to a hotel  but was too polite to say anything to stuart herself  on the second day my eldest     woke and sat up in the top bunk to find herself covered in cobwebs  and this was not just a tiny one in a corner   this was months of no cleaning   my   year old lost her bedsock under the bottom bunk and came out covered in dust and grime and cried  this was just horrible  my own shed was no better  could stuart maybe clean the windows once in a while  this was like the inside of a garden shed after some years of spiders and dirt  if you now wonder whether i may just be a complaining  cleanliness obsessed idiot then please get in touch and i will send you some photos  we live in an old and crumbly house in a very rural area and are used to basic facilities and a lack of modern   ,2

8539,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Kevin,be warned this is very basic accommodation  we went  for a long weekend in november from thursday night to sunday  however we left saturday morning as description not accurate  stuart the host is very amiable and very helpful always checking to see if your ok  the views are stunning  those are the good points  these are not log cabins they are large sheds  there is no living space so you are confined to your bed i know we went in november but the convector heater in the main shed is not adequate unless you have multiple layers on   no heating in kitchen so eating in there was not possible and if more then   of you there is no room  outside shower is no more then an area between the   sheds with a shower door put on and you stand on a concrete slab after you clear all the leaves and muck away  sauna and outside bbq were not used as they needed a quite a fierce heat to get them started  a small point is that all rooms have tv s but there is no signal so you have vhs videos to watch  woke up on saturday morning to no hot water  which was the last straw so we left  this is not a reflection on stuart  just the accommodation  ,2
8540,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Natalie,brilliant experience although the weather wasn t on our side  rained solid   so didn t manage to make the most of what was on offer in the cabins bath  shower  treehouse  however stuart was a brilliant host making us feel welcome and welcomed us in his home congratulating us on our engagement   beautiful area and views    such a quirky place to stay  brilliant imagination put into this accommodation   we can t wait to have a trip back to stuart s next summer    ,5
8541,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Corinna,we stayed one night at the cabin  if your looking for something out of a hoseasons catalogue  then this is not for you   however if your looking for a beautiful cabin  with plenty of space to share with your nearest and dearest or just get away from it all  with its beautiful rustic charm then this is the place for you  from everything from the wood burung sauna  up cycled firepit  to the outdoor bath  the whole place leaves you feeling completely relaxed  it is set in beautiful surroundings and during our stay we were lucky enough to use the outside bath  starring up into the clear night sky and see   shooting stars   stuart was a great host and had time to come and chat with us and he couldn t be more helpful  bottom line is we will be returning for more than 1 night next time  one thing i would say is make sure you go in suitable transport  as a lowered sports car  isn t the most practical mode of transport down the track to stuart s place  ,5

8603,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Mike,hidden away in the hills  the cabins are a great hideaway for a couples retreat or a group visit  visiting in february  it was cold on the evening making the showering an experience  with what seemed to be an unlimited supply of hot water we had no trouble keeping warm in there  it was getting out which proved to be difficult  alternately there is the outdoor bath but we opted to get  in the sauna as quickly as possible  and stayed there for the rest of the night      stuart was very welcoming  upon arrival we realized we forgot the tonic for our gin so instead of pointing us to the local shop  we were welcomed into his home for a drink and to be provided with a bottle of tonic  we also received a tour of his amazing home     will hopefully be visiting again in the summer to make the most of the outdoor area and maybe even the tree house ,5

8606,Three log cabins with WC and Sauna and Treehouse," Huts for Rent in Llanwddyn, United Kingdom ",Stuart,Nath,fantastic experience  stuart has built three cabins  which was perfect for our group of five  the whole set up is really unique  at the top of a valley with a river running nearby and a whole lot of peace and quiet    we stayed over new years  so it was a bit cold out  however we were able to warm up with the heaters in the cabin  and with the homemade sauna and bath tub  all great features    one area for improvement in heating terms is that the second cabin  with the bunk beds  was a bit colder than the other two cabins  meaning we ended up having four to a double bed in the warmer room  this was fine for us  but could be improved in the future for other winter guests  wouldn t be a problem in summer    would highly recommend the experience if you re looking for a peaceful retreat in nature  ,5
